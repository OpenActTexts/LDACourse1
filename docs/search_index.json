Resources How to Navigate this Tutorial A Word from our Sponsor: Astin + Education = Astin Academy Contributors", " Loss Data Analytics: Short Course A short course authored by the Actuarial Community Preface Date: 17 August 2021 Why Loss Data Analytics? The intent is that this type of short course will eventually permeate throughout the actuarial curriculum. Given the dramatic changes in the way that actuaries treat data, analysis of loss data seems like a natural place to start. The idea behind the name loss data analytics is to integrate classical loss data models from applied probability with modern analytic tools. In particular, we recognize that big data (including social media and usage based insurance) are here to stay and that high speed computation is readily available. Resources This tutorial is based on the first five chapters of the open and freely available book Loss Data Analytics. Sample code is available for the book, although not needed for this tutorial. As described in how to navigate this tutorial below, you will not need to download any data for this course. However, if you want to have the data to follow up, we generally make it available through buttons such as: View the Property Fund Data as a .csv file. Then, do a Save Page as if you wish to download. Alternatively, go directly to the Github page to access the data. For advanced data applications in insurance, you may be interested in the series, Predictive Modeling Applications in Actuarial Science. How to Navigate this Tutorial This online tutorial is designed to guide you through the foundations of modeling loss data. The anticipated completion time is approximately ten hours. The tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the foundations in the statistical software R, such as Datacamps Introduction to R or Codecademys Learn R. Role of Video Introductions. There are five chapters in this tutorial that summarize the foundations. Each chapter is subdivided into several sections. At the beginning of each section is a short video, typically 5-10 minutes, that summarizes the section key learning outcomes. Following the video, you can see more details about the underlying R code for the analysis presented in the video. Role of Exercises. Following each video introduction, there are one or two exercises that allow you to practice skills to make sure that you fully grasp the learning outcomes. The exercises are implemented using an online learning platform provided by Datacamp so that you need not install R. Feedback is programmed into the exercises so that you will learn a lot by making mistakes! You will be pacing yourself, so always feel free to reveal the answers by hitting the Solution tab. Remember, going through quickly is not equivalent to learning deeply. Use this tool to enhance your understanding of one of the foundations of data science. Video: Overview of Tutorial Navigation A Few More Tips For the videos, with this player you hit the CC button and then English to see closed captions. You can also experiment with the speed of the video (the 1x symbol) and other standard video player features. When completing the tutorial exercises, replace the question marks ?? by the appropriate code (in earlier versions, we used underscores). The graphical displays upon completion of the tutorial exercises appear only in the narrow window of the code and do not look good. This is a limitation of the Datacamp platform. For a more professional looking graph, in many cases you can simply copy the code and paste it into your own version of R to enhance its appearance. However, be careful with this approach. Sometimes, as part of the background, we pre-load data and libraries that you dont see unless you dig down. (How to do this? Go to our Github site!) When a tutorial exercise finishes with a graph, the (green) success message is obscured. To see it, after completing the exercise, hit the R-Console button at the top. Then re-size the html page and immediately revert back to the full page mode. This procedure allows you to view the message. Devices and Browsers. We tested the course on popular devices and browers. Our videos and tutorial exercises seemed to behave well on all the devices we looked at, including cell phones, Ipads, Apple and PC laptop/desktops. Most problematic is the .pdf overheads. These dont seem to work well at all on cell phones and Ipads. For Apple and PC laptop/desktops: When you view the .pdf output for the overheads with the browser FireFox, the default is for the table of contents to appear. The fix for this is to click the icon in the upper left-hand corner. For other browsers we tested (Edge and Chrome), the page of the .pdf that you select on appears the first time. You can either refresh every time you select a new page or, an easier route, scroll down to the appropriate page to see the desired output. Let us know about other bugs you encounter. We may not be able to address them but at least we can add notes here to warn other users. Some of the exercises are more challenging and you may wish to skip them on your first pass through the course. These are indicated with this symbol: A Word from our Sponsor: Astin + Education = Astin Academy In this video, you learn about: the role of the ASTIN section, the non-life section of the International Actuarial Association their recent interest in education their development of the recently formed Astin Academy.

Claim Frequency Assignment Text The Wisconsin Property Fund data has already been read into a data frame called Insample. These data consist of claim experience for fund members over the years 2006-2010, inclusive. It includes the frequency of claims Freq as well as the claim year Year. The video explored the distribution of the claims frequency for year 2010; in this assignment, we replicate this analysis and conduct a similar investigation for year 2009. Instructions. For each year: Use the function subset() to create a smaller data set based on a single year. Define the frequency as a global variable. Use the function length() to determine the number of observations in a vector. Use the function mean() to calculate the average.

Exploring Claim Severities Assignment Text The Wisconsin Property Fund data covering years 2006-2010 has already been read into a data frame called Insample. These data includes the average claim severity yAvg. The video explored the distribution of the claims severity for year 2010; in this assignment, we conduct a similar investigation for year 2009. Instructions Use the function subset() twice, once to create a smaller data set based on year 2009 experience and again to restrict consideration to fund members with positive claims. From this subset, define the average claim severity as a global variable. Use the function length() to determine the number of members with positive claims. Use the function summary() to calculate several summary statistics. Use the function hist() to produce histograms that visualize the claim severity distribution. Do this once on the original scale and again on the logarithmic scale.

1.4.2 Exercise. Skewness of the Claim Severity Distribution Assignment Text Many distributions used in insurance analytics are skewed. In this assignment, we demonstrate how to detect the skewness and show that skewness is a feature of an entire data set, not the result of a handful of outlying observations. Specifically, we consider the average claim for year 2010 of the Wisconsin Property Fund data that has been made available in the (global) variable AvgClaim; this variable is only for fund members with positive claims. The video remarked on the skewness of this variable and used a logarithmic transformation to facilitate the analysis. In this assignment, we show how an alternative strategy, omitting unusually large observations, does not address the skewed nature of the distribution. Instructions Use the functions mean() and median() to compute both the mean and median of AvgClaim. You will see that the mean is much larger than the median, a classic diagnostic approach for establishing the right skewness of a distribution. Use the function order() to order the data in terms of decreasing size. Use the function head() to examine the 10 largest observations. Create 6 histograms, graphically presenting them in panels that have 2 rows and 3 columns. In the first histogram, omit the 9 largest observations. In the second, omit the 6 largest. Continuing this pattern, omit 5 in the third histogram, omit 3 in the fourth, omit 1 in the fifth, and do not admit any in the sixth. A careful inspection of this panel of histograms reveals that the distribution remains skewed, despite repeatedly removing large outlying observations. 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 1.4.3 Exercise. Claim Severity by Year Assignment Text Much of insurance analytics is about making predictions of future behavior. To understand distributions in future years, we look at trends in distributions from the current and preceding years. Some simple trends that are helpful not only for understanding but also communicating results to others involve looking at the mean, or average, behavior. In this assignment, we examine 2006-2010 of the Wisconsin Property Fund that has been previously loaded into the data frame Insample. As in the video, by Year we calculate mean values of claims frequency (Freq), average claims severity (yAvg) and coverage (BCcov), as well as the number of fund members. Instructions Load the library needed to use the function ddply(). (The documentation provides that name of the library needed to run this function.) With this function, produce a data frame with the requisite summary statistics. To document results, provide intuitive names of these summary statistics using the names() function. Before displaying the data frame, tidy up the results a bit by rounding the mean values of claim frequency to three digits using the round() function. Also, present the mean coverage in thousands (of dollars), rounding to zero digits.

Claim by Entity Type, Fire Class, and No Claim Credit Assignment Text Analytics of insurance data has much in common with analytics in other areas but insurance also has its own peculiarities. One of example of this is how one only examines summary statistics for positive claims. (Mathematically, the claim severity distribution is defined conditional on the occurrence of a claim). As a consequence, we often need to write specialized routines for insurance applications. Your supervisor finds useful the analysis of claims outcomes by entity type, fire class, and no claim code (already completed in the video). To make this analysis more impactful, the supervisor wants you to modify the code to include a basic measure of uncertainty, the standard deviation. Instructions Modify the function created for this specific analysis, ByVarSumm(), to include the standard deviation statistic. Note that, like the mean, we only calculate the standard deviation on the sub-sample of positive claims. Include this standard deviation statistic as part of your table output. 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 Contributors Authors.

Aggregate claims are affected by both the frequency and the severity of the insured event. Decomposing aggregate claims into these two components, each of which warrant significant attention, is essential for analysis and pricing. This chapter discusses frequency distributions, summary measures, and parameter estimation techniques. Although not needed to go through the tutorials, some users may wish to download the overheads that the videos are based on. Download Chapter Two overheads as a .pdf file. By watching the videos and working through the tutorial exercises, you will get an appreciation for frequency modeling. For a deeper dive, see the corresponding chapter in the textbook, Chapter Two of Loss Data Analytics. 2.1 Basic Frequency Distributions In this section, you learn how to: Determine quantities that summarize a distribution such as the (cumulative) distribution as well as moments such as the mean and variance. Define and compute the moment and probability generating functions. Describe and understand relationships among three important frequency distributions, the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions.

Representing the Number of Cyber Events with a Binomial Distribution Assignment Text Cyber risk for a firm is based on its liability for a data breach involving sensitive customer information, such as Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, account numbers, drivers license numbers and health records. A company models its cyber risk using the following assumptions: In any calendar quarter, there can be at most one cyber event. In any calendar quarter, the probability of a cyber event is 0.1. The numbers of cyber events in different calendar quarters are mutually independent. Based on these assumptions, you represent the total number of cyber events as a binomial distribution. Instructions Identify the binomial distribution parameters for the number of cyber events in a 12 quarter (3 year) period. Calculate the probability that there are \\(k\\) cyber events for \\(k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 12\\) using the function dbinom(). Create a data frame to present your results. All values within a specific column should be rounded to the same number of decimal places. Display the data frame. Graph the probability mass function of the number of cyber events using the function barplot(). Include a descriptive title and axis labels for the graph. 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 2.1.2 Exercise. Representing the Number of Cyber Events with a Poisson Distribution Assignment Text Another company is also concerned with cyber risk. Compared to the company in the prior exercise, this company is larger and does not wish to assume at most one cyber event in a quarter. Moreover, it believes that the distribution of cyber events is a function of its technical support staff size that has increased over time. Thus, it wishes to model the number of cyber events as a Poisson distribution with expected number of events as: \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{l|cccccc} \\hline \\text{Quarter} &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3&amp; 4&amp; 5&amp; 6 \\\\\\hline \\text{Expected Number}&amp; 0.1 &amp; 0.1 &amp; 0.1 &amp; 0.1 &amp; 0.2 &amp; 0.2 \\\\ \\hline \\text{Quarter} &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9&amp; 10&amp; 11&amp; 12 \\\\ \\hline \\text{Expected Number}&amp; 0.2 &amp; 0.2 &amp; 0.3 &amp; 0.3 &amp; 0.4 &amp; 0.5 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Assuming that the numbers of cyber events in different calendar quarters are mutually independent, the total number of cyber events over the three year period (12 quarters) has a Poisson distribution with expected number \\(\\lambda = 2.7\\). (Recall that the sum of independent Poisson random variables has a Poisson distribution.) Instructions Graph the probability mass function (pmf) of the number of cyber events using the function barplot(). Calculate the pmf and the cumulative probability distribution function for \\(k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 12\\) cyber events using the functions dpois(), ppois().

Comparing Basic Count Distributions Assignment Text Your supervisor would like to have a better understanding of relationships among three important count distributions, the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial. You could develop a mathematical appendix, demonstrating how: A binomial distribution with parameters \\(m \\to \\infty\\) and \\(mq \\to \\lambda\\) converges to a Poisson distribution. A negative binomial distribution with mean parameter \\(r \\beta = \\lambda\\) and dispersion parameter \\(r\\) converges to a Poisson distribution as \\(r \\to \\infty\\). Instead, you decide to demonstrate these relationships graphically. Instructions Plot the probability mass function (pmf) of the binomial distribution with \\(m=12\\) and \\(q=0.1\\) over \\(k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 12\\) potential outcomes. Superimpose on this plot a Poisson pmf with the same mean using the lines() function. Repeat this step with the same Poisson distribution but, for the binomial distribution, multiply \\(m\\) by 5 and divide \\(q\\) by 5. (You should see how the binomial becomes a better approximation to the Poisson.) Determine the pmf of the negative binomial distribution with mean parameter \\(r \\beta\\) and dispersion parameter \\(r=1\\) using the function dnbinom(). Use the same mean as for the binomial distribution. Demonstrate the convergence of the negative binomial to the Poisson by creating side-by-side graphical comparisons. That is, using the par(mfrow = ) syntax, compare: A plot of this negative binomial distribution pmf, superimposed with baseline Poisson distribution (with the same mean). A plot of the negative binomial distribution pmf with the same mean and dispersion parameter \\(r=100\\), superimposed with baseline Poisson distribution. 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 2.2 The (a,b,0) Class In this section, you learn how to: Define the \\((a,b,0)\\) class of frequency distributions. Discuss the importance of the recursive relationship underpinning this class of distributions. Identify conditions under which this general class reduces to each of the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions.

Determining Probabilities Recursively Assignment Text The \\((a,b,0)\\) class can be expressed through the recursion \\[ \\Pr(N=k) = p_k = p_{k-1} \\left( a+ \\frac{b}{k}\\right) , \\quad k\\ge 1 , \\] where \\(N\\) is a count random variable. From Section 2.3 of the text, we know that: if \\(a=0\\) and \\(b=\\lambda\\), then the recursion yields a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\) if \\(a=-q/(1-q)\\) and \\(b=(m+1)q/(1+q)\\), then the recursion yields a binomial distribution with parameters \\(m\\) and \\(q\\) if \\(a=\\beta/(1+\\beta)\\) and \\(b=(r-1)\\beta/(1+\\beta)\\), then the recursion yields a negative binomial distribution with parameters \\(r\\) and \\(\\beta\\). The \\((a,b,0)\\) class is a foundation for other, more complex, distributions, so let us check that we understand the recursions. Instructions For \\(k=0, \\ldots, 20\\), using \\(\\lambda = 1.24\\) obtain \\(p_k\\) values using dpois(). With the starting value \\(p_0 = \\exp(-\\lambda)\\), use the recursive \\((a,b,0)\\) formula to obtain these probability values. Check your code by summing over the absolute value of the differences between the dpois and the \\((a,b,0)\\) generated values. For \\(k=0, \\ldots, 20\\), obtain \\(p_k\\) values using the negative binomial distribution using the function dnbinom(). Use the same mean as for the Poisson distribution but let the variance be 1.1 times the mean. Hint. See the Loss Data Analytics Summary of Distributions for the parameterization used in this short course. It differs from that used by the R package. Use the recursive \\((a,b,0)\\) formula to obtain these probability values. Check your code by summing over the absolute value of the differences between the dnbinom and the \\((a,b,0)\\) generated values. 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 2.2.2 Exercise. Reverse Engineering and Recursive R Functions Assignment Text You want to generate probabilities from the \\((a,b,0)\\) class so that later on you will be able to modify your code to produce alternative distributions (the subject of Section 2.5), a bit of so-called reverse engineering. In the first part of this problem, from a known distribution (e.g., the binomial), you will compute the ratio \\[ \\frac{k ~p_k}{p_{k-1}} = a k + b , \\quad k\\ge 1 , \\] to determine values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part of this problem utilizes recursive R functions. This is a function defined in terms of the same function but at a prior iteration. The classic example is the factorial function \\(f(n) = n!\\) so \\(f(n) = n f(n-1)\\). For example, you can define the function recursive.factorial &lt;- function(n) { if (n == 0) return (1) else return (n * recursive.factorial(n-1)) } to determine that recursive.factorial(5) = 120. In this problem, we use a recursive R function to generate \\((a,b,0)\\) probabilities. Instructions For \\(k=0, \\ldots, 4\\), using \\(\\lambda = 1.24\\) obtain \\(p_k\\) values from the dpois() function. Compute the ratio to identify values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hint: In R, use of negative indexing is permitted. For example, pop[-c(3, 7)] removes the third and seventh elements of pop. For \\(k=0, \\ldots, 4\\), using \\(q =0.1\\) and \\(m=10\\) obtain \\(p_k\\) values from the dbinom() function. Compute the ratio to identify values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). To check your work, develop the recursive \\((a,b,0)\\) function to determine \\(p_4 = \\Pr(N=4)\\) based on the binomial distribution in the prior part. 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 2.3 Estimating Frequency Distributions In this section, you learn how to: Define a likelihood for a sample of observations from a discrete distribution.

Count Data Compression - 1 Assignment Text Raw count data can often be compressed without loss of any statistical information. Typically, the compression is to the sequence of values \\(\\{m_k\\}_{k\\geq 0}\\), where \\(m_k\\) is the number of observations equal to \\(k\\), that is, \\(m_k=\\sum_{i= 1}^n I(x_i=k).\\) In this and the following exercise, we discuss two data structures for this compressed data and suggest implementations in R. Instructions Store the count data \\(\\{3, 6, 0, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 6, 2, 3, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2\\}\\) into an array, say \\(\\bf x\\), using the c() (for concatenate) function Use the table() function to generate a frequency table of the data. Initialize an array (say \\(\\bf m.vec\\)) to hold the summarized counts of frequency, \\(m_0, m_1, \\ldots\\). Do this using the rep() function that replicates the values in \\(x\\). (It is a generic function, and the (internal) default method is described here.) Fill in the appropriate values into the array \\(\\bf m.vec\\). Some illustrative code uses the functions names() (functions to get or set the names of an object), as.integer() (it creates or tests for objects of type integer), and as.vector() (it produces a vector of the given length and mode). Use the array \\(\\bf m.vec\\) to determine the mean frequency. With the array \\(\\bf m.vec\\), determine the count distribution using the function barplot() (it creates a bar plot with vertical or horizontal bars). 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 2.3.2 Exercise. Count Data Compression - 2 Assignment Text In Exercise 2.3.1, the count data range was narrow - counts range from 0 to 6. In that case the suggested manner to store \\(m_k\\)s worked well. In Section 1.3 of this short course, the Wisconsin Property Fund data has been introduced which consists of claim experience for fund members over the years 2006-2010, inclusive. It includes the frequency of claims Freq as well as the claim year Year. The Wisconsin Property Fund data has already been read into a data frame called Insample. In this assignment, we will compress the claims frequency data using a data structure that differs from that presented in the preceding exercise. Instructions Using the dataframe Insample, create a smaller data set based on year 2007 experience. From the 2007 experience, create a frequency table. Store distinct claim counts observed into an array named \\(\\bf values\\). Store the frequency of claim counts into an array named \\(\\bf m.vec\\). Use the array \\(\\bf m.vec\\) to determine the mean frequency. The frequency table shows one observation with 157 claims. Use the match() function to verify this. (This function returns a vector of the positions of (first) matches of its first argument in its second). With the array \\(\\bf m.vec\\), graph the count distribution. 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 Video: Fitting a Poisson Distribution 2.3.3 Exercise. Graphing Likelihoods Assignment Text In this assignment you are asked to plot the Poisson likelihood and the log-likelihood for the data from Exercise 2.3.1. It is instructive to see that the maximum for both the curves are attained at the same point, the sample mean. These data have already been read into an array \\(\\bf x\\) with the counts in the array \\(\\bf m.vec\\). Once you have a working code, scroll through the plots to understand what each piece of graph code does. Instructions Write the likelihood as a function of the parameter \\(\\theta\\). Create an array with values of \\(\\theta = 1, 1.01, 1.02, \\ldots, 5\\). Plot the likelihood over values of \\(\\theta\\). You may find useful the function sapply(). (It applies a function over a list or vector.) Plot the log-likelihood over values of \\(\\theta\\). Superimpose a vertical line at the mean to emphasize that both the likelihood and the log-likelihood reach their maximum values at the mean. For this, use the abline() (this function adds one or more straight lines through the current plot). 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 Video: Fitting Binominal and Negative Binomial Distributions Overheads: Fitting Binominal and Negative Binomial Distributions (Click Tab to View) A. Binomial Model B. Negative Binomial Model C. Reason Behind non-existence of MLE D. REVIEW Hide Hide Hide Hide 2.3.4 Exercise. Fitting a Binomial Distribution Assignment Text In this assignment you are asked to fit the binomial model to a small set of count data, \\(\\{1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 0, 2, 4, 3, 4\\}\\). Recall that in this parameterization of the binomial model, \\(m\\) is the potential number of 1s (the number of trials). You will recall from Section 2.4.2 of Loss Data Analytics that when \\(m\\) is known, the mle of \\(q\\) is simply a sample average. Because \\(m\\) is restricted to integer values, it is convenient to resort to brute force maximization of the reduced likelihood in order to find the mle for \\(m\\). But then it is a must to visually confirm the solution by plotting the reduced log-likelihood. Note that it is important to check that the sample mean exceeds sample variance for the mle of \\(m\\) to be finite - lest the Poisson is the better model. The data are available in an array \\(\\bf x\\) and the array \\(\\bf m.vec\\) of Exercise 2.3.1 is also made available. Instructions Develop the reduced likelihood function based on the compressed data in the array \\(\\bf m.vec\\). The value of \\(m\\) must be at least as large as the largest observed value in the sample. Calculate potential values of the reduced likelihood over a range beginning from the maximum value in \\(\\bf m.vec\\). Determine the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters \\(m\\) and \\(q\\) by selecting the largest likelihood. For this, you will find helpful the function match() (it returns a vector of the positions of (first) matches of its first argument in its second). To check your results, plot the likelihood function over a range of \\(m\\). Superimpose a vertical line at the mle. Check to see whether the sample mean is greater than the sample variance. Doing so, you can use the function var() (it computes the variance using a denominator of \\(n-1\\)). To avoid this, the sample code instead uses var(c(x,mean(x))) instead of var(x). Ask yourself why? 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 2.3.5 Exercise. Fitting a Negative Binomial Distribution Assignment Text In this assignment, you are asked to fit the negative binomial model to a small set of count data, \\(\\{1, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 2, 5, 11\\}\\). Because \\(r\\), a parameter of the negative binomial distribution, is a positive real number, it is convenient to use the optimize function for maximizing the reduced likelihood in order to find its mle. It is always advisable to visually confirm the solution by plotting the reduced log-likelihood. Note that it is important to check that the sample mean is lower than sample variance for the mle of \\(r\\) to be finite - lest the Poisson is the better model. The data are available in an array \\(\\bf x\\) and the array \\(\\bf m.vec\\) of Exercise 2.3.1 is also made available. Instructions Develop the reduced log-likelihood function based on the compressed data in the array \\(\\bf m.vec\\). The optimization routine will need a range of potential values of \\(r\\). The illustrative code uses a moment estimator (based on techniques that we will cover formally later in Section 4.1.1 of Loss Data Analytics). Determine the value of \\(r\\) that minimizes the reduced log-likelihood using the function optimize() (a one dimensional optimization function). To check your results, plot the reduced log-likelihood function over a range of \\(r\\). Superimpose a vertical line at the mle. Check to see whether the sample mean is smaller than the sample variance. Is this consistent with the negative binomial distribution? 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 2.4 Other Frequency Distributions In this section, you learn how to: Define the \\((a,b,1)\\) class of frequency distributions and discuss the importance of the recursive relationship underpinning this class of distributions.

The (a,b,1) Distribution and its Moments (As a reminder, when you see this symbol, it means that this exercise is challenging and you may wish to skip it on your first pass through the course.) Assignment Text An earlier exercise used recursions for the \\((a,b,0)\\) class of distributions. The \\((a,b,1)\\) features the same recursion but it starts at \\(k=2\\). In this assignment you are given \\(p_1\\), \\(p_2\\) and \\(p_3\\) (in an array \\(\\bf p\\)) from an \\((a,b,1)\\) distribution. You are tasked to identify the distribution and compute its mean and variance. Instructions. For this exercise, you may find it useful to review matrix operations in R. For one nice resource click here. Setup equation in matrix form and solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Consider a \\(2 \\times 2\\) coefficient matrix \\(\\bf C\\) such that \\({\\bf C} \\left(\\begin{array}{c}a \\\\ b \\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}p_3/p_2 \\\\ p_2/p_1 \\end{array}\\right)\\). Write an expression for \\(\\bf C\\). Invert the matrix \\(\\bf C\\) and solve for the vector of coefficients \\(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a \\\\ b \\end{array}\\right)\\). Use the sign of the coefficients to identify the \\((a,b,1)\\) distribution. Use the functional form of this distribution to compute pmf up to \\(p_{100}\\) directly. From these generated probabilities, determine the mean and the variance. From the functional form, use the closed form expressions for this distribution to check your mean and the variance calculations in the prior step.

Mixtures of Workers Compensation Claims Assignment Text You are analyzing a set of workers compensation claims (claims that pay in the event of injury at a work-place) and focus on the frequency portion. Suppose that it is known that if claims arise from a low-risk class, such as accountants and actuaries working within four walls, that the number of claims follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda=4\\). However, if claims arise from a high-risk class, such as roofers and lumberjacks, then the number follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters \\(r=4\\) and \\(\\beta=3\\). For a particular firm, you do not know whether it is low or high risk but you do know that probability of being low-risk is \\(\\alpha=0.6\\). In this exercise, we will compare the shape of the mixture distribution to the low and high risk distributions. Instructions Determine the probability mass functions for the low and high risk populations for \\(k=0, \\ldots, 20\\) possible claim outcomes. Compute the corresponding probability mass function for the mixture distribution. Plot the mixture distribution with superimposed lines for the low and high risk populations. Use different colors and plotting symbols for the three distributions to help viewers distinguish among them. Determine distribution functions for the low, high, and mixture distributions. Plot the mixture distribution function with superimposed lines for the low and high risk populations. 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 2.5.2 Exercise. Finite Number of Mixture Distributions Assignment Text The following describes a classic actuarial exam problem. We use this problem to motivate an introduction of more complex techniques for calculating mixture distributions. Unlike classic exam problems designed for hand calculations, these techniques can readily be extended to a large number of unobserved sub-populations. In a certain town the number of common colds an individual will get in a year follows a Poisson distribution that depends on the individuals age and smoking status: \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{l|cc} \\hline &amp; \\text{Proportion of population} &amp; \\text{Mean number of colds} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Children} &amp; 0.3 &amp; 3 \\\\ \\text{Adult Non-Smokers} &amp; 0.6 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\text{Adult Smokers} &amp; 0.1 &amp; 4 \\\\\\hline \\end{array} } \\] In this exercise, we will use R to calculate the probabilities that a randomly drawn person has a cold in a year. Instructions Create a vector of proportions \\(\\alpha\\) and a vector of Poisson parameters \\(\\lambda\\). Use the function dpois() to obtain a vector of Poisson probability mass function (pmf) with different means for \\(k=3\\) colds. Then, use the matrix operation %*% to obtain the mixture pmf as the inner product of the two vectors containing the Poisson pmfs and population percentages. In the same way, use the ppois() function to compute the probability of at most 3 colds within a year. Now, consider \\(k=0, \\ldots, 8\\) colds during a year. For each value of \\(k\\), determine the probability of \\(k\\) colds within a year. Provide a barplot() of the distribution of number of colds during a year over the range \\(k=0, \\ldots, 8\\). 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 2.5.3 Exercise. Gamma Mixture of Poissons Assignment Text For a population, suppose that each risk has a Poisson number of claims with a parameter \\(\\lambda\\) that is specific to that risk (an infinite number of risk classes). We can think of the risk parameter as following a distribution and so is itself random, denoted as a capital \\(\\Lambda\\). A mathematically convenient assumption is to assume that the risk parameter follows a gamma distribution. That is, as we have learned from the text, a gamma mixture of Poissons turns out to have a negative binomial distribution. More precisely, if \\(N|\\Lambda \\sim\\) Poisson\\((\\Lambda)\\) and \\(\\Lambda \\sim \\text{gamma}(\\alpha, \\theta)\\), then \\(N \\sim \\text{Negative Binomial}\\) \\((r = \\alpha, \\beta = \\theta)\\). For example, one can determine the probability mass function of \\(N\\) as \\[ \\Pr(N=k) = \\int^{\\infty}_0 e^{-\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!} ~ g(\\lambda;\\alpha, \\beta = \\theta )~ d \\lambda, \\] where \\(g(\\cdot;\\alpha, \\beta = \\theta )\\) is a gamma density. The proof of this result is in the text; here, we check it using R, in the special case of \\(k=3\\), \\(\\alpha =3\\), and \\(\\theta = 4\\). Instructions Establish the parameter values for \\(\\alpha =3\\) and \\(\\theta = 4\\). Express the conditional Poisson mass function as a function of the parameter \\(\\lambda\\) (not the number of outcomes \\(k\\)) (called lambda.arg for the lambda argument in the following sample code). Express the product of the conditional Poisson mass function and the gamma density as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). integrate() this product over values of \\(\\lambda\\). Check the result by using the negative binomial probability mass function. Repeat this process using distribution functions in lieu of probability mass functions. Specifically, express the product of the conditional Poisson distribution function and the gamma density as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). Integrate this and check the result using the negative binomial distribution function. 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 2.6 Goodness of Fit In this section, you learn how to: Calculate a goodness of fit statistic to compare a hypothesized discrete distribution to a sample of discrete observations.

Example: Singapore Automobile Data C. Fitting a Poisson D. Adequacy of the Poisson Model Hide Hide Hide Hide 2.6.1 Exercise. Goodness of Fit: Zero-Modified Poisson Assignment Text A dataset pertaining to a 1993 portfolio of 7,483 automobile insurance policies from a major Singaporean insurance company that contains several characteristics to explain automobile claim frequency is provided by the General Insurance Association of Singapore. The claims frequency is contained in the field Clm_Count, and the data set has already been read into a data frame called Insample and made available to you. You can learn more about the data set at Singapore Auto Claims (see description of Table 19: Singapore Auto Claims on page 21). In this assignment, you are asked to fit a zero-modified Poisson using the mle method and test the goodness of fit. In a sense, it is a continuation of the example discussed in Section 2.7 of Loss Data Analytics where the inadequacy of the Poisson model was observed. The mle of \\(p_0\\) is simply the number of zeros divided by the sample size. The mle of \\(\\lambda\\) turns out to be the solution of the equation \\[ \\frac{{\\lambda}}{1-\\exp({-\\lambda})}=\\frac{\\sum_{k\\geq0} k \\cdot m_k}{n-m_0}. \\] You can learn more about the development of the mle below. Verify Development of the MLE derivation for zero-modified Poisson MLE derivation for zero-modified Poisson: The zero-modified Poisson is a type of \\((a,b,1)\\) distribution that has two parameters. This is seen by the form of its pmf, \\[ p_k:=\\frac{(1-p_0)}{1-\\exp(-\\lambda)} \\exp(-\\lambda) \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!}, k=1,2,\\ldots, \\] with \\(p_0\\in[0,1]\\) and \\(\\lambda&gt;0\\). The nice part of this two-parameter family is that the likelihood factorizes into two parts which are solely a function of exactly a single parameter - one corresponding to \\(p_0\\) and the other to \\(\\lambda\\). This is shown below: \\[ L(p_0,\\lambda)= \\underbrace{\\left(p_0^{m_0} (1-p_0)^{n-m_0}\\right)}_{\\hbox{$p_0$-part}}\\underbrace{\\left( (1-\\exp(-\\lambda))^{-(n-m_0)} \\lambda^{\\sum_{k\\geq1} km_k}\\right)}_{\\hbox{$\\lambda$-part}} \\underbrace{\\left(\\prod_{k\\geq 1} (k!)^{m_k}\\right)^{-1}}_\\hbox{Constant} . \\] The above observation implies maximizing the likelihood with respect to both the parameters can be reduced to two one-variable maximization problems. The first part is precisely a Bernoulli likelihood, the maximization results in the mle of \\(p_0\\) given by \\(\\hat{p_0}=m_0/n\\). Maximizing the second part implies that the mle \\(\\hat{\\lambda}\\) satisfies, \\[ \\frac{\\hat{\\lambda}}{1-\\exp(\\hat{-\\lambda})}=\\frac{\\sum_{k\\geq0} k \\cdot m_k}{n-m_0}. \\] Observe that the right hand side equals \\(\\bar{x}/(1-\\hat{p_0})\\). As an aside, the latter being the empirical mean of positive counts and \\(\\frac{{\\lambda}}{1-\\exp({-\\lambda})}\\) its population analog lend a method-of-moments interpretation for the mle. Computing \\(\\hat{\\lambda}\\) then reduces to solving the equation \\[ \\frac{{\\lambda}}{1-\\exp({-\\lambda})}=\\frac{\\sum_{k\\geq0} k \\cdot m_k}{n-m_0}. \\] Because the left-hand side is a strictly increasing function (show this using calculus and the fact that \\(e^x\\geq 1+x\\); otherwise, see the plot of the function below) on \\([0,\\infty)\\) assuming a value of \\(1\\) at \\(0\\) and increasing to infinity, and the right-hand side is at least \\(1\\) (Why?), there is a unique solution to the above equation. In other words, \\(\\hat{\\lambda}\\) is well-defined. Instructions To get a feel for the data, start by generating the frequency table. Store distinct claim counts observed in array named values. Store the frequency of claim counts in \\(\\bf m.vec\\). Calculate sample mean of claim counts and the mle for \\(p_0\\). Code the function that provides the framework for determining the mle of \\(\\lambda\\) Find the mle of \\(\\lambda\\) by solving for the root of the function using uniroot(). (This function searches the interval from lower to upper for a root (i.e., zero) of the function f with respect to its first argument.) Construct a 2 by 1 vector containing the observed and estimated probabilities. The five bins are \\(\\{0\\}, \\{1\\},\\) \\(\\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{4,5,...\\}\\). Use a barplot to compare observed and estimated probabilities. Compute the chi-square statistic and the 95th percentile of the appropriate chi- square distribution.

The estimated aggregate loss distribution combines the loss frequency distribution and the loss severity distribution by convolution. Discrete distributions often referred to as counting or frequency distributions were used in Chapter 2 to describe the number of events such as number of accidents to the driver or number of claims to the insurer. Lifetimes, asset values, losses and claim sizes are usually modeled as continuous random variables and as such are modeled using continuous distributions, often referred to as loss or severity distributions. A mixture distribution is a weighted combination of simpler distributions that is used to model phenomenon investigated in a heterogeneous population, such as modeling more than one type of claims in liability insurance (small frequent claims and large relatively rare claims). In this chapter we explore the use of continuous as well as mixture distributions to model the random size of loss. Although not needed to go through the tutorials, some users may wish to download the overheads that the videos are based on. Download Chapter Three overheads as a .pdf file. By watching the videos and working through the tutorial exercises, you will get an appreciation for distributions used to model the severity of losses. For a deeper dive, see the corresponding chapter in the textbook, Chapter Three of Loss Data Analytics. 3.1 Basic Distributional Quantities In this section, you learn how to work with some basic distributional quantities: moments, percentiles, and generating functions.

Moments Can Be Misleading Assignment Text Anscombes quartet is comprised of four datasets with interesting properties related to their moments. You can access the data via data(anscombe). The four data sets are in the variables y1, y2, y3 and y4. There are also associated x values that create interesting properties for regression models fit to the data. Well ignore the x values in this section but will use them to develop the plots below. Instructions Extract the values y1, y2, y3 and y4 from the anscombe data frame. You will want to extract these as vectors not as single-column data frames. Use summary() to understand the basic distributional properties of y1, y2, y3 and y4. Use mean() to calculate the first raw moment of y1, y2, y3 and y4. Assign the values to y_means. Use var() to calculate the second raw moment of y1, y2, y3 and y4. You should note that the var() function uses \\(n-1\\) in the denominator to return an estimate of the population variance from the sample. Do you notice anything interesting about the results? Use sd() to calculate the standard deviation of y1, y2, y3 and y4. As with the var() function, sd() also uses \\(n-1\\) in the denominator. There is no base-R function to calculate the coefficient of skewness. There are several approaches to calculate skewness if you explore the help() for the type argument of the skewness function from the e1071 package. We will not use this package, but instead we will we calculate the equivalent of type = 3 skewness using var in the denominator. 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 3.1.2 Exercise. Determining Boxplots and Quantiles Assignment Text The boxplot() function produces box-and-whisker plots of grouped values. The boxplot() function returns certain statistics and produces a plot as a side effect. Explore the documentation to understand the values returned. In particular review the information returned by the stats attribute of this object. The Wisconsin Property Fund data has already been read into a data frame called Insample. These data consist of claim experience for fund members over the years 2006-2010, inclusive. It includes claim values y as well as the claim year Year. For this exercise we will work with the natural logarithm of the claim values which are in the lny variable. We have filtered the data to exclude zero claims and saved the resulting data frame as Insample_nz. Instructions We provide the code to generate the boxplot. Note that the R creates the boxplot as a side effect while returning information about the data. (R does not print the information to the console by default. You will have to assign the return of the boxplot function to an object to access.) What is the class of the of the object returned by the boxplot function? Access the stats attribute of the object returned. Use the quantile() function and replicate the hinge values for 2008 box. We will ignore the values returned for the whiskers as they are not a function of the quantiles of the distribution. We selected the 2008 year because it has an odd number of observations. Use the quantile() function on a vector with an even number such as 1:100 and access the 25th percentile. Are you surprised by the result? Review the details for the type argument to the quantile() to understand the various approached to determining quantiles. 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 3.1.3 Exercise. Gamma Moment Generating Function Assignment Text In Example 3.1.4 of Loss Data Analytics you will find a discussion of the moment generating function for a gamma distribution, \\[ M_X(t) = (1 - \\theta t)^{-\\alpha} . \\] We will work with this distribution in this exercise. The parameters that we will use in our exercise are \\(\\alpha=2\\) (the shape parameter) and \\(\\theta = 10\\) (the scale parameter). Keep in mind that the mean for this distribution is \\(\\alpha\\theta=20\\) and the variance is \\(\\alpha\\theta^2 = 200\\). We will revisit these results at the end of the exercise. There are several R functions that you will find useful: The parse() function converts a character vector to an expression(). Then, you can use the eval() to evaluate the expression. You can use the D() to compute derivatives. Instructions Use the parse() function to create an expression and for the moment generating function. Specify the expression using alpha, theta and t. Name the object mgf. Note the class of mgf. Evaluate mgf at t = 0 when alpha = 2 and theta = 10. (Note that you do not need to specify the values of alpha and theta and t in the eval call. That is because we did not specify the envir argument to eval and the default is parent.frame(). Environments are a more advanced R topic that you can learn about here. 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 3.1.4 Exercise.

For \\(\\theta = 10\\) and \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\), note that mgf goes to +inf when \\(t = \\frac{1}{\\theta} = 0.1\\). The right-hand panel shows the function between -0.01 and 0.01.

R provides a family of functions associated with statistical distributions. The naming convention is to precede the distribution name with d for the density function, p for the cumulative distribution function, q for quantiles (percentiles), and r for random number generation. (We will set aside the r functions for Chapter 6 in Loss Data Analytics and focus on d, p, and q functions.) The stats packages which is provided with base-R includes the distributions listed here. Many other distributions are available in other R packages. For the exercises in the section, we will focus on the gamma distribution from Section 3.2.1 of Loss Data Analytics to help you develop an intuition as to how the distribution responds to changes in its shape and scale parameter. From Figure 3.1, you should recognize that the support for the gamma distribution is positive real numbers. Youll also note that the distribution allows for varying levels of right-skewness.

We can access the information generated with the histogram by assigning the result to an object. For this exercise, you should assign that information to hist_data. Note the class of hist_data. Use the str() function to review the structure of elements of the list returned by the histogram function hist(). 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 3.2.2 Exercise. Visualizing the Gamma Distribution Assignment Text From the histogram, we will develop an intuition as to whether a gamma distribution is likely to fit this data reasonably well. Consider whether the data is uni-modal and whether it is right-skewed. It appears to be which would support the modeling of log-claim sizes using the gamma distribution. Youll note that the \\(y\\)-axis of the histogram displays counts. In contrast, the dgamma function returns density values. So we cant add a gamma distribution to the histogram and compare to the data. Instead we first need to plot the density values of the data. To plot probability densities, we will use set the probability argument to hist to TRUE. You should note the following from the documentation of hist: The relationship between the that the probability and freq arguments to hist. There is a density argument to hist. As first, you may think this refers to the (probability) density function, but that argument specifies a plotting feature. You can use the curve() function to plot the gamma distribution over the histogram data. To do this, you need to set the add argument to TRUE. In later sections, well review approaches to parameter estimation. In this section, we will vary the shape and scale parameters to understand the flexibility of the gamma distribution. The data will serve as a reference for this exercise. You may recall from the exercises from Section 3.1.3 that the mean of the gamma function is the product of the shape and scale parameters and the variance is the product of the shape and square of the scale parameters. You can use this information to develop parameter estimates using the method of moments. Instructions Again plot the histogram. This time specify the probability argument so as to plot probability densities. Calculate shape and scale parameters using the method of moments Calculate the density values for \\(x\\) values displayed within the limits of the plot. Add 3 to the shape parameter and note how the distribution changes. Subtract 0.05 from the scale parameter and note how the distribution changes. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJwcmVfZXhlcmNpc2VfY29kZSI6Indpc2NfcHJvcCA8LSByZWFkLmNzdihcImh0dHBzOi8vcmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbS9PcGVuQWN0VGV4dERldi9MREFDb3Vyc2UxL21haW4vRGF0YS9JbnNhbXBsZS5jc3ZcIiwgaGVhZGVyPVQsIG5hLnN0cmluZ3M9YyhcIi5cIiksIHN0cmluZ3NBc0ZhY3RvcnMgPSBGQUxTRSlcbndpc2NfcHJvcCA8LSBsb2cod2lzY19wcm9wJHlbd2lzY19wcm9wJHkgPiAwXSkiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJoaXN0X2RhdGEgPC0gaGlzdCh4ID0gPz8sIHByb2JhYmlsaXR5ID0gPz8pXG5nYW1tYV9zY2FsZSA8LSB2YXIoPz8pIC8gbWVhbig/PylcbmdhbW1hX3NoYXBlIDwtIG1lYW4oPz8pIC8gZ2FtbWFfc2NhbGVcbmN1cnZlKGRnYW1tYSh4LCBzaGFwZSA9ID8/LCBzY2FsZSA9ID8/KSwgYWRkID0gVFJVRSwgY29sID0gJ3JlZCcgKVxuZ2FtbWFfc2NhbGVcbmdhbW1hX3NoYXBlXG5jdXJ2ZShkZ2FtbWEoeCwgc2hhcGUgPSA/PyArID8/LCBzY2FsZSA9ID8/KSwgYWRkID0gVFJVRSwgY29sID0gJ2JsdWUnKVxuY3VydmUoZGdhbW1hKHgsIHNoYXBlID0gPz8sIHNjYWxlID0gPz8gLSAgPz8pLCBhZGQgPSBUUlVFLCBjb2wgPSAnZ3JlZW4nKSIsInNvbHV0aW9uIjoiaGlzdF9kYXRhIDwtIGhpc3QoeCA9IHdpc2NfcHJvcCwgcHJvYmFiaWxpdHkgPSBUUlVFKVxuZ2FtbWFfc2NhbGUgPC0gdmFyKHdpc2NfcHJvcCkgLyBtZWFuKHdpc2NfcHJvcClcbmdhbW1hX3NoYXBlIDwtIG1lYW4od2lzY19wcm9wKSAvIGdhbW1hX3NjYWxlXG5jdXJ2ZShkZ2FtbWEoeCwgc2hhcGUgPSBnYW1tYV9zaGFwZSwgc2NhbGUgPSBnYW1tYV9zY2FsZSksIGFkZCA9IFRSVUUsIGNvbCA9ICdyZWQnIClcbmdhbW1hX3NjYWxlXG5nYW1tYV9zaGFwZVxuY3VydmUoZGdhbW1hKHgsIHNoYXBlID0gZ2FtbWFfc2hhcGUgKyAzLCBzY2FsZSA9IGdhbW1hX3NjYWxlICsgIDApLCBhZGQgPSBUUlVFLCBjb2wgPSAnYmx1ZScpXG5jdXJ2ZShkZ2FtbWEoeCwgc2hhcGUgPSBnYW1tYV9zaGFwZSArIDAsIHNjYWxlID0gZ2FtbWFfc2NhbGUgLSAgMC4wNSksIGFkZCA9IFRSVUUsIGNvbCA9ICdncmVlbicpIiwic2N0Ijoic3VjY2Vzc19tc2coXCJXZWxsIGRvbmUhXCIpIn0= 3.2.3 Exercise.

Using the Logarithmic Transformation to Create a New Distribution Assignment Text For this exercise we will be modeling claim severity data with a gamma distribution, and we will then apply a log transformation to the distribution. (Recall that we use the natural logarithmic transform throughout, unless specified otherwise.) In this exercise we generate the probability density function (pdf) of the gamma distribution that corresponds with these parameters, and we then plot the pdf of the log of the claim severities, by transforming the gamma pdf. We will assume that the claim severities follow a gamma distribution with a known shape parameter \\(\\alpha=0.63\\) and scale parameter \\(\\theta=16897\\). Instructions Use dgamma() to generate a pdf of the claim severities. You are given the shape parameter \\(\\alpha= 0.63\\) and scale parameter \\(\\theta=16897\\) for the gamma distribution fit.

Creating a Mixture Distribution Assignment Text Insurance portfolios often consist of subpopulations which might have different claim severity distributions. In this exercise, we will use the Wisconsin Property Fund data to generate a mixture distribution, where it is assumed that different entities (village, city, country, miscellaneous, school and town) have different claim severity distributions. We use the following assumptions: We will use the number of claims for each entity from the data as weights for the mixture distribution. For each entity, the claim severities are assumed to be gamma distributed with different shape parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and different scale parameters \\(\\theta\\). You can modify the code used in Exercise 1.5.1 to extract the claim numbers from the Property Fund data. After combining the gamma probability density functions together to produce a mixture distribution, we plot the pdfs for the log of the claim severities for each subpopulation and the mixture distribution. Instructions Extract the number of claims from the Property Fund data. Combine the gamma density functions for the claim severity for each subpopulation together to generate the pdf of a mixture distribution. When generating the mixture distribution, use the number of claims for each entity as weights. Use dgamma() to generate the pdf of the claim severities for each subpopulation. The parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\) for each subpopulation are given below. Plot each of the pdf curves of the log claim severities in the same figure. Exercise 3.3.1 shows how to find the pdf for log claim severities. Superimpose the pdf of mixture distribution of the log claims on to the plot of the pdf curves of the log claim severities. The values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\) for the fitted gamma distribution for each entity type are: \\[{\\small \\begin{matrix} \\begin{array}{l | r | r} \\hline \\text{Entity Type} &amp; \\alpha~~~ &amp; \\theta~~~ \\\\ \\hline \\text{Village} &amp; 0.630 &amp; 16897\\\\ \\text{City} &amp; 0.511 &amp; 33119\\\\ \\text{County} &amp; 0.637 &amp; 24259\\\\ \\text{Misc} &amp; 0.347 &amp;

Calculate Moments of the Lognormal Distribution Assignment Text The support of the lognormal distribution is positive real numbers and the distribution is right-skewed. Given these properties, claim values for many coverages follow a lognormal distribution. R provides many several functions related to the lognormal() distribution. Particularly useful for calculations related to the effect of coverage modifications, the plnorm() function returns the distribution function for a lognormal. Specifically, the limited expected value function is useful for calculating limited claim values, that is, claims amounts subject to policy limits. See the summary in Section 18.2.5 of Loss Data Analytics. The limited expected value of \\(X\\) at limit, \\(L\\), can be calculated as follows: \\[ LEV[x;L] = \\int_0^L x f_X(x) ~dx ~+ L \\times [1 - F_X(L)] . \\] The first term on the right-hand side is the contribution to the expected value for claims that are less than \\(L\\) and the second term is the expected value of all claims greater than or equal to \\(L\\). For the exercises in this section, we provide the mlnorm() and levlnorm() functions to calculate unlimited mean and limited expected values, respectively with arguments meanlog and sdlog corresponding to the same arguments in the plnorm() function. The levlnorm() function requires an additional limit argument. We also provide the vector claims which are observed claims values from lognormal distribution with meanlog = 12 and sdlog = 1.5. The values of meanlog and sdlog are saved in the mu and sigma objects. Instructions Calculate the expected value of the lognormal function and compare to the mean of claims. Calculate the expected value of the claims retained by the insured using the levlnorm() function and the compare to the mean of claims. 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 3.4.2 Exercise.

Expected Claims Subject to a Deductible Assignment Text When an insurer provides coverage with a deductible, only a portion of claims result in reimbursement. The claims that do produce reimbursement have a greater average value than the average value for all claims. For this exercise, assume that an insurer provides coverage for the first \\({\\$}\\) 5 million of claims in excess of a \\({\\$}\\) 1 million deductible. Note that this coverage is sometimes stated as \\({\\$}\\) 4 million excess of \\({\\$}\\) 1 million (or shorthand notation such as ${$}$4 mln xs ${$}$1 mln). Instructions Determine the number of claims resulting in reimbursement. Compare to the expected value of the number of claims requiring reimbursement calculated using the plnorm function. Calculate the amounts insured. Do this in two steps. First, subset claims to only include amounts in excess of ${$}$1 million. Second, calculate the average value of those claims. Calculate the expected value of the claims insured subject to a ${$}$1 million deductible and a ${$}$5 million policy limit using the levlnorm and plnorm function and the compare to the amounts you calculated in the prior step. Note that these are the ground-up values meaning that they include the amounts within the deductible. 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 Video: Policy Coinsurance and Reinsurance Overheads: Policy Coinsurance and Reinsurance (Click Tab to View) A.

Review Hide Hide Hide Hide Hide Hide Hide 3.4.4 Exercise. Expected Claims Subject to a Deductible and Coinsurance Assignment Text For this exercise, assume that an insurer provides coverage for the first ${$}$5 million of claims in excess of a ${$}$1 million deductible. Note that this coverage is sometimes states as ${$}$4 million excess of ${$}$1 million (or shorthand notation such as ${$}$4mln xs ${$}$1 mln). (This is the same as the prior exercise.) However, now you should assume that there is a 20% coinsurance provision. The number of claims will not differ from the prior exercise, so will focus on the average value. Instructions Calculate the expected insured value of the claims subject to a ${$}$1 million deductible and 20% coinsurance and a ${$}$5 million policy limit using the levlnorm and plnorm function and the compare to the amounts insured from claims. In contrast to the prior exercise, calculate the insured value of the claim rather than the ground-up value. 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 3.5 Maximum Likelihood Estimation In this section, you learn how to: Define a likelihood for a sample of observations from a continuous distribution.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation for a Pareto Distribution Assignment Text For this exercise we will undertake maximum likelihood estimation to fit a Pareto distribution to claim severity data. Because we have two parameters in a Pareto distribution, undertaking maximum likelihood involves finding the estimates that maximize the likelihood surface. Visualizing the likelihood surface may help to gain an appreciation of how maximum likelihood works. After finding the parameter estimates, we plot out a contour plot of the likelihood and mark the maximum likelihood estimates on the plot. Instructions Extract claim severity data from the Property Fund data. Write a function to calculate the negative log-likelihood for the claim severity data, assuming that claim severity is Pareto distributed. The pdf function for a Pareto distribution [dpareto()], which was created in Exercise 3.2.3, can be used when finding the negative log-likelihood. Find the maximum likelihood estimates by using optim() to minimize the negative log-likelihood. Plot a contour plot of the likelihood using contour(), and use points() to mark the maximum likelihood estimates on the plot. 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 3.5.2 Exercise. Finding Standard Errors for Maximum Likelihood Estimates Assignment Text For this exercise we calculate 95% confidence intervals for the parameters based on estimates that we found in Exercise 3.5.1. The theory underpinning mle confidence intervals is described in Section 15.3 of Loss Data Analytics. The parameters that we have estimated depend on the data, and since the data can be considered as a random sample from a larger unknown population, maximum likelihood estimators are random variables. A property of maximum likelihood is that the estimators converge in distribution to a normal distribution, as \\(n\\) gets larger. If we minimize the negative log-likelihood, we can use the Hessian matrix (which is a matrix of the second-order partial derivatives) to find the variance of the estimators. Specifically, the standard errors of the estimators are equal to the square root of the diagonal elements of the inverse of the Hessian matrix. Some useful R functions for this exercise are: The solve() function can be used to find the inverse of a square matrix. The diag() function extracts the diagonal of a matrix. The qnorm() function which finds quantiles of a normal distribution. Instructions Use solve() to calculate the inverse of the Hessian matrix. The Hessian is one of the outputs from the optim() function, and can be extracted from lik_result which was found in the previous exercise. Use diag() to extract the diagonals of the inverse of the Hessian. Calculate the standard errors of the parameter estimates by taking the square root of the diagonal elements of the inverse of the Hessian matrix. Use the standard errors to calculate 95% confidence intervals. 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 Contributors Authors.

This chapter begins with the selection of models. To compare alternative parametric models, it is helpful to summarize data without reference to a specific parametric distribution. Section 4.1 describes nonparametric estimation, how we can use it for model comparisons and how it can be used to provide starting values for parametric procedures. The process of model selection is then summarized in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. Although our focus is on data from continuous distributions, the same process can be used for discrete versions or data that come from a hybrid combination of discrete and continuous distributions. Model selection and estimation are fundamental aspects of statistical modeling. To provide a flavor as to how they can be adapted to alternative sampling schemes, Sections 4.4 and 4.5 describes estimation for grouped, censored and truncated data. To see how they can be adapted to alternative models, the chapter closes with Section 4.6 on Bayesian inference, an alternative procedure where the (typically unknown) parameters are treated as random variables. Although not needed to go through the tutorials, some users may wish to download the overheads that the videos are based on. Download Chapter Four overheads as a .pdf file. By watching the videos and working through the tutorial exercises, you will get an appreciation for model selection and estimation. For a deeper dive, see the corresponding chapter in the textbook, Chapter Four of Loss Data Analytics. 4.1 Nonparametric Inference In this section, you learn how to: Estimate moments, quantiles, and distributions without reference to a parametric distribution.

Density Estimators Assignment Text Nonparametric density estimators, such as the kernel estimator, are regularly used in practice. In this tutorial, We will use the Wisconsin Property Fund data, which already has been read into a data frame called Insample, to plot a histogram and overlay density curves with various density estimators. Instructions Plot a histogram of logarithmic loss amount y. Use the function density() to compute kernel density estimates. Overlay density curves on top of the histogram: using a blue thick curve to represent a Gaussian kernel density where the bandwidth was selected automatically using an ad hoc rule based on the sample size and volatility of these data, using a green thick curve to represent a Gaussian kernel density with a bandwidth equal to 1, using a red thick curve to represent a triangular kernel density with a bandwidth of 0.1. 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 4.1.3 Exercise. Claim Frequency Assignment Text In this tutorial, you will model claim count data and decide whether a Poisson\\((\\lambda)\\) or a negative binomial\\((r=3,p)\\) better fits the data. The raw data are the number of claims filed by \\(n=100\\) policyholders. Recall that claim count data are discrete and take values \\(0, 1, 2, \\dots\\). So, we consider two discrete probability models. You will apply tools learned in Section 4.1 to make a decision on which model fits these data better. We also start with exploratory data analysis, making graphical and numeric summaries of data before fitting a model. Instructions Make a table of the claims counts. Make a barplot to graphically display the claims counts. Compute the mean and variance of the claims count distribution. Based on these, do you think a Poisson or a negative binomial model might be better? 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 Observe that the distribution is heavily right-skewed, and the sample variance is much larger than the sample mean.

Instructions Fit the Poisson distribution by estimating \\(\\lambda\\) using maximum likelihood estimation. Make a \\(qq\\) plot comparing the observed data to the fitted Poisson. Fitting the distribution involves estimating the parameter \\(\\lambda\\). Do you recall the maximum likelihood estimator for a Poisson?

This plot says the empirical quantiles are too large, thats why they are above the diagonal line \\(y=x\\). Our claims data are too right-skewed, and thats why the \\(qq\\) plot seems off for larger quantiles. Might the negative binomial might be more promising? Instructions Fit the negative binomial by using the method of moments estimator to estimate \\(p\\). Make a \\(qq\\) plot comparing the observed data to the fitted negative binomial. To fit the Negative Binomial(\\(r=3, \\beta\\)), we need to estimate the parameter \\(\\beta\\) using the method of moments. Recall that the probability mass function for a negative binomial (Sec 2.2.3.3 of Loss Data Analytics) is \\[ \\Pr(X = k) = \\frac{(k+r-1)!}{k!(r-1)!}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\beta}\\right)^r \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta} \\right)^k, \\hspace{5mm} k=0, 1, ... \\] with parameters \\(r\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Also recall that in the method of moments we equate the \\(t^{th}\\) sample moment and \\(t^{th}\\) model moment, \\[ \\mathrm{E}(X^t) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^t, \\] where \\(t=1, 2, ...\\). If we use \\(t=1\\) to equate the first moments, we get the expression \\[ \\mathrm{E}(X) = r\\beta = 3\\beta = \\overline{x} = 3 \\] Solving the above for \\(\\beta\\), we see \\(\\hat{\\beta} = 1\\). Therefore the Negative Binomial(\\(r=3, \\beta=1\\)) is the fitted model. Next, we use R to fit this and make a \\(qq\\) plot. It is important to understand that distributions are not uniquely parameterized, and there can be different conventions across fields, textbooks, and software. Indeed, in R the function defines the negative binomial as \\[ \\Pr(X = k) = \\frac{(k+n-1)!}{(n-1)!k!}p^n(1-p)^k, \\hspace{5mm} k=0, 1, ... \\] This matches the definition in the textbook by equating probability \\(p = \\frac{1}{1+\\beta}\\), and size \\(r=n\\). It is very important to carefully consider the parameterization of any distribution you use in R. 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 4.2 Tools for Model Selection In this section, you learn how to: Summarize the data graphically without reference to a parametric distribution.

In this tutorial, you will generate \\(pp\\) plots with Gaussian and gamma distribution. Instructions Generate \\(pp\\) plots for the positive loss amount y using Gaussian and gamma. Based on the \\(pp\\) plots, which parametric fitted model is closer to the empirical distribution? Use the function glm(response~1,data=,family=Gamma(link=log)) to fit generalized linear model (glm) with gamma family. Find the shape and rate parameters from the fitted gamma glm. (No action required on your part.) Use the function glm(response~1,data=,family=gaussian(link=log)) to fit generalized linear model (glm) with Gaussian distribution. Find the mean and standard deviation from the fitted Gaussian glm. (No action required on your part.) Use the function ecdf() to create the empirical distribution for positive loss. Use the function pgamma() to create distribution function for the gamma distribution.

This exercise uses the glm() function to produce maximum likelihood estimates of certain classes of distributions including the gamma and Gaussian (normal). Section 3.5 of Loss Data Analytics employs a comparable function, vlgm(). These functions are even more useful when employed in regression modeling contexts. Although regression modeling is outside the scope of this course, the exercise provides an initial exposure to these functions that are very useful in actuarial practice. 4.2.2 Exercise. Quantile-Quantile (\\(qq\\)) plot Assignment Text The \\(pp\\) plot shows cumulative distribution functions, which can sometimes be difficult to detect where a fitted parametric distribution is deficient. As an alternative, it is common to use a quantile-quantile (\\(qq\\)) plot. The Wisconsin Property Fund data has already been read into a data frame called Insample and we also created a subset data which includes only positive loss data called positive_loss. In this tutorial, you will generate \\(qq\\) plots with Gaussian and gamma distribution. Instructions Generate \\(qq\\) plots for the positive loss amount y using Gaussian and gamma. Based on the \\(qq\\) plot, which parametric fitted model is closer to the empirical distribution? Find sample size, mean, variance, and standard deviation for the positive loss. p_value is a list of probabilities that is given here. Use the function qnorm() to create quantile function for the Gaussian distribution. Use the function qgamma() to create quantile function for the gamma distribution. 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 4.2.3 Exercise.

Recall that for this problem, the prior distribution was \\[ \\pi(q) = q^3/0.07, \\hspace{5mm} 0.6 \\leq q \\leq 0.8. \\] two observations from a Bernoulli(q) were \\(X_1 = 1, X_2 = 0\\), and the posterior was found (Example 4.4.1) to be \\[ \\pi(q \\mid 1,0) = \\frac{q^4 - q^5}{0.014069}. \\] Instructions Make a plot of the prior distribution. Think about how you expect the observed data to reshape it to the posterior. Add the posterior and a legend to your plot, to confirm the influence of the observed data. This requires advanced commands such as lines and legend. 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 Notice that the prior distribution sets the support for \\(q\\), which is bounded between 0.6 and 0.8. The posterior will necessarily have this same support. Notice also that the prior distribution places more mass for larger values of \\(q\\). This is saying that prior to observing data, we think larger parameters values near 0.8 are more likely than smaller values near 0.6 The observed data has a claim in year 1 (\\(X_1 = 1\\)) and no claim in year 2 (\\(X_2 = 0\\)). So, we have two independent samples drawn from a Bernoulli(q), and \\(\\overline{X} = 0.5\\). If we were only using the likelihood and a method such as maximum likelihood estimation, we would estimate \\(\\widehat{q} = \\overline{X} = 0.5\\). So these data are telling us that values near \\(q=0.5\\) are consistent. But, Bayesian methods blend information from the data with information from the prior to produce a posterior. So, expect that our posterior distribution will place more mass towards smaller values of \\(q\\), and less towards larger values. Lets see if that is true. 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 Indeed, the posterior has shifted the mass towards lower values, balancing what the data tell us and what the prior tells us. Since this is only two data points, the shift is not especially dramatic. Assignment Extension Lets continue with the prior example, but now imagine we next observe the third year, and there was again no claim, \\(X_3 = 0\\). We will compute the new posterior distribution, and compare it to the posterior in the previous problem. Instructions Make a plot showing the original prior, posterior from example 4.1.1, and posterior for the new case. The posterior distribution after observing three data points is: \\[ \\pi(q \\mid 1,0,0) \\propto f(1\\mid q)f(0\\mid q)f(0\\mid q)\\pi(q) = q(1-q)(1-q)q^3 = q^4 - 2q^5 + q^6 \\] Recall the posterior is proportional to \\(q^4 - 2q^5 + q^6\\), so that means \\[ \\pi(q \\mid 1,0,0) = c \\left(q^4 - 2q^5 + q^6 \\right). \\] In order to find the normalizing constant \\(c\\), we would need to integrate this and make sure the integral is 1: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp;= \\int_{q=0.6}^{0.8} c \\left(q^4 - 2q^5 + q^6\\right)dq\\\\ &amp;= c \\left(\\frac{1}{5}q^5 - \\frac{2}{6} q^6 +\\frac{1}{7} q^7 \\right) \\rvert_{q=0.6}^{q=0.8}\\\\ &amp;= c \\left( 0.0081 - 0.00400 \\right)\\\\ &amp;= c \\left(0.0041 \\right)\\\\ \\end{array} \\] Thus, we see the normalizing constant is \\(c = \\frac{1}{.0041}\\). We can now revisit the code and add the new posterior line: 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 As expected, the new posterior has shifted even more mass towards lower parameter values in the posterior, since \\(\\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) and the data are more consistent with low parameter values for \\(q\\).

We present two standard modeling approaches, the individual risk model and the collective risk model. Further, we discuss strategies for computing the distribution of the aggregate claims, including exact methods for special cases, recursion, and simulation. Finally, we examine the effects of individual policy modifications such as deductibles, coinsurance, and inflation, on the frequency and severity distributions, and thus on the aggregate loss distribution. Although not needed to go through the tutorials, some users may wish to download the overheads that the videos are based on. Download Chapter Five overheads as a .pdf file. By watching the videos and working through the tutorial exercises, you will get an appreciation for aggregate loss models.

Individual Risk Model II Assignment Text Continuing our work in Exercise 5.2.1, we now reproduce the theoretical results for calculation of moments in individual risk models using simulation. We use the simulated frequencies for each group of policies from Exercise 5.2.1 and continue to simulate compound losses in an individual risk model as elaborated in Section 5.4.2 on Loss Data Analytics. Instructions Use the function runif() to claim amounts that follow uniform distribution for each group of policies. Specify the parameters of uniform random variables, minimum and maximum values of claim amounts from each type of policies. Initialize an empty vector of length \\(R\\) to store \\(R\\) observations of simulated \\(S\\). In each simulation, calculate the \\(j\\)th simulated aggregate loss and store it in \\(j\\)th component of \\(S\\) for \\(j=1, \\ldots, R\\). Compute the mean and variance of \\(S\\) by simulation using mean() and var().

Collective Risk Model II Assignment Text In this assignment, we will analyze the aggregate loss distribution by combining fitted frequency and severity components. Since it is usually very hard to obtain a closed form expression for the distribution function of the compound loss in a collective risk model, we rely on simulations to compute the aggregate loss distribution. Instructions We use the fitted frequency and severity models using LGPIF data as we have done in Tutorial 5.3, with negative binomial and Pareto distributions, respectively. To generate random samples from the fitted frequency and severity models, we use rnbinom() and rlomax(). Note that these generated random samples are used as inputs to compute the aggregate claim amount distribution. We use aggregateDist() to simulate compound losses that match the observed data upon the fitted frequency and severity models. It is an important task in order to visualize the distribution of compound losses and make subsequent decisions on ratemaking.

5.5 Tweedie Distribution In this section, we learn how to: Construct the Tweedie distribution from a collective risk model. Establish the Tweedie distribution as a member of the exponential family of distributions. Fit Tweedie distribution as a generalized linear model.

Example E. Example - R Code Hide Hide Hide Hide Hide 5.5.1 Exercise. Tweedie Distribution Assignment Text In this assignment, we will fit a Tweedie model for a collective risk model using observed compound losses in LGPIF data with R. Unlike the previous tutorials that required separate model fitting for the frequency and severity components, use of Tweedie distribution enables us to fit a collective risk model in one step. Instructions For the likelihood of the compound loss, We use dtweedie(), which is one of the built-in functions of R library tweedie . From the fitted Tweedie model via optim(), extract the estimated mu, phi, and p. After estimating the parameters of the Tweedie model, plot the empirical quantiles against the quantiles from the fitted model. Note that we generate the theoretical quantiles via qtweedie() and the estimated Tweedie parameters. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJwcmVfZXhlcmNpc2VfY29kZSI6Ikluc2FtcGxlIDwtIHJlYWQuY3N2KFwiaHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL09wZW5BY3RUZXh0RGV2L0xEQUNvdXJzZTEvbWFpbi9EYXRhL0luc2FtcGxlLmNzdlwiLCBoZWFkZXI9VCwgbmEuc3RyaW5ncz1jKFwiLlwiKSwgc3RyaW5nc0FzRmFjdG9ycz1GQUxTRSlcbmxpYnJhcnkobG1lNClcblxuc291cmNlKFwiaHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL09wZW5BY3RUZXh0RGV2L0xEQUNvdXJzZTEvbWFpbi9SQ29kZS9Ud2VlZGllU291cmNlQ29kZS5SbWRcIikiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJJbnNhbXBsZVRvd24gPC0gc3Vic2V0KEluc2FtcGxlLCBUeXBlVG93bj09MSlcblxuIyBUaGUgVHdlZWRpZSBjb21wb3VuZCBsb3NzIG1vZGVsOiBTXG5TIDwtID8/JHlcbmNvbXBsb3NzX2xpayA8LSBmdW5jdGlvbihwYXJtKSB7XG4gIG11ICAgIDwtIHBhcm1bMV1cbiAgcGhpICAgPC0gcGFybVsyXVxuICBwICAgICA8LSBwYXJtWzNdXG4gIGxpayAgPC0gLXN1bSggIGxvZyhkdHdlZWRpZShTLCBtdT1tdSwgcGhpPXBoaSwgcG93ZXI9XykpIClcbiAgcmV0dXJuKGxpaylcbn1cbmluaXQucGFybS5jb21wbG9zcyA8LSBjKCBtZWFuKFMpLCAzMDAsIDEuNSkgICAgIyBpbml0aWFsIGVzdGltYXRlcyBcbmNvbXBsb3NzX21vZCAgICAgICA8LSBvcHRpbShwYXI9Pz8sXG4gICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgZm49Pz8sIG1ldGhvZD1cIkwtQkZHUy1CXCIpICMgTWF4aW11bSBsaWtlbGlob29kIGVzdGltYXRpb24gZm9yIHRoZSBjb21wb3VuZCBsb3NzIG1vZGVsXG5cblxubXUuZXN0ICA8LSBjb21wbG9zc19tb2QkcGFyWzFdXG5waGkuZXN0IDwtIGNvbXBsb3NzX21vZCQ/P1xucC5lc3QgICA8LSBjb21wbG9zc19tb2QkPz9cblxucGN0IDwtIHNlcSgwLjAxLDAuOTksMC4wMSlcbnBsb3QocXR3ZWVkaWUocGN0LCBtdT0/PywgcGhpPT8/LCBwb3dlcj1wLmVzdCkgLHF1YW50aWxlKEluc2FtcGxlVG93biR5LCBwcm9icz1wY3QpLCB4bGFiPVwiVGhlb3JldGljYWwgUXVhbnRpbGVcIiwgeWxhYj1cIkVtcGlyaWNhbCBRdWFudGlsZVwiLCB4bGltPWMoMCw1MDAwMCksIHlsaW09YygwLDUwMDAwKSlcbmFibGluZSgwLDEpIiwic29sdXRpb24iOiJJbnNhbXBsZVRvd24gPC0gc3Vic2V0KEluc2FtcGxlLCBUeXBlVG93bj09MSlcblxuIyBUaGUgVHdlZWRpZSBjb21wb3VuZCBsb3NzIG1vZGVsOiBTXG5TIDwtIEluc2FtcGxlVG93biR5XG5jb21wbG9zc19saWsgPC0gZnVuY3Rpb24ocGFybSkge1xuICBtdSAgICA8LSBwYXJtWzFdXG4gIHBoaSAgIDwtIHBhcm1bMl1cbiAgcCAgICAgPC0gcGFybVszXVxuICBsaWsgIDwtIC1zdW0oICBsb2coZHR3ZWVkaWUoUywgbXU9bXUsIHBoaT1waGksIHBvd2VyPXApKSApXG4gIHJldHVybihsaWspXG59XG5pbml0LnBhcm0uY29tcGxvc3MgPC0gYyggbWVhbihTKSwgMzAwLCAxLjUpICAgICMgaW5pdGlhbCBlc3RpbWF0ZXMgXG5jb21wbG9zc19tb2QgICAgICAgPC0gb3B0aW0ocGFyPWluaXQucGFybS5jb21wbG9zcyxcbiAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICBmbj1jb21wbG9zc19saWssIG1ldGhvZD1cIkNHXCIpICMgTWF4aW11bSBsaWtlbGlob29kIGVzdGltYXRpb24gZm9yIHRoZSBjb21wb3VuZCBsb3NzIG1vZGVsXG5cblxubXUuZXN0ICA8LSBjb21wbG9zc19tb2QkcGFyWzFdXG5waGkuZXN0IDwtIGNvbXBsb3NzX21vZCRwYXJbMl1cbnAuZXN0ICAgPC0gY29tcGxvc3NfbW9kJHBhclszXVxuXG5wY3QgPC0gc2VxKDAuMDEsMC45OSwwLjAxKVxucGxvdChxdHdlZWRpZShwY3QsIG11PW11LmVzdCwgcGhpPXBoaS5lc3QsIHBvd2VyPXAuZXN0KSAscXVhbnRpbGUoSW5zYW1wbGVUb3duJHksIHByb2JzPXBjdCksIHhsYWI9XCJUaGVvcmV0aWNhbCBRdWFudGlsZVwiLCB5bGFiPVwiRW1waXJpY2FsIFF1YW50aWxlXCIsIHhsaW09YygwLDUwMDAwKSwgeWxpbT1jKDAsNTAwMDApKVxuYWJsaW5lKDAsMSkiLCJzY3QiOiJzdWNjZXNzX21zZyhcIldoaWxlIFR3ZWVkaWUgZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uIGVuYWJsZXMgdXMgdG8gZml0IGEgY29tcG91bmQgbG9zcyBkaXN0cmlidXRpb24gaW4gb25lIHN0ZXAsIGFjdHVhbCBjbGFpbXMgZGF0YXNldCBtaWdodCBub3QgZml0IGludG8gdGhlIGRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbiBlc3BlY2lhbGx5IHdoZW4gd2Ugb2JzZXJ2ZSBoZWF2eS10YWlsIGJlaGF2aW9yLlwiKSIsImhpbnQiOiJGb3IgVHdlZWRpZSBkaXN0cmlidXRpb24sIHdlIGVzdGltYXRlIHRocmVlIHBhcmFtZXRlcnMgKG11LCBwaGksIHApIHRoYXQgZXhwbGFpbiB0aGUgb3ZlcmFsIG1lYW4sIGRpc3BlcnNpb24sIGFuZCBzaGFwZSBvZiB0aGUgZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uLiJ9 5.6 Effects of Coverage Modifications In this section, we learn how to: Examine the impact of aggregate deductible on the aggregate loss.
