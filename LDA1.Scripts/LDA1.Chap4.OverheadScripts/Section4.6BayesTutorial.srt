1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:10,640
all right so here we're going to expand on 
one of the videos from the textbook and use it  

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,640
to explore a little bit more what a bayesian prior 
distribution is what a posterior distribution is  

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:28,880
and what a predictive distribution is so getting 
right to it we're going to look at example 4.4.5  

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,680
this is an actuarial exam question and 
here's what we're given the probability  

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,280
that an insured has at least one loss in 
any given year is p so that's our parameter  

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,360
this is a bayesian problem so we're going 
to focus on uh the prior distribution  

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,880
for that one parameter and we're 
told it's uniform between 0 and 0.5  

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,800
but for one particular customer they've had 
eight consecutive years of at least one loss  

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,320
and we're asked to calculate the posterior 
probability that that person will again have  

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,280
another loss in year nine okay so just thinking 
about it it seems like this particular customer  

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,200
has a much higher probability of 
giving losses we've seen eight in a row  

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,720
we might really guess that they're likely to 
have a ninth one and this is a classic example  

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,080
of the power of bayesian methods so we'll start 
with a little bit of notation i'm going to call  

14
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:44,000
x i equal one the customer had at least one loss

15
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,040
in year i

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,800
and of course this parameter p sitting right 
here is understood as the probability that  

17
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:06,000
x i is equal to one okay so that's 
the setup what are they asking me for  

18
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,960
they're asking for the posterior probability 
that this person will have a loss in year nine

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:27,520
the probability that x nine is equal to one given 
they've had a loss every year for eight years okay  

20
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:35,840
given that they had a loss in year one two three 
four five six seven all the way through eight

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:49,840
this is what i'm being asked to find and 
this is the posterior predictive distribution

22
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,160
why is that the posterior predictive 
distribution well let's take a look at it

23
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:08,080
all of this information right here 
x1 through x8 this is past theta  

24
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:17,840
given i have observed that 
what can i say about the future

25
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,880
what can i say about another unobserved 
random variable okay so i take what i  

26
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,880
know about the past and i'm somehow supposed to 
use that to better inform a future prediction  

27
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,600
and as the textbook shows the 
definition of this thing of course  

28
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,840
is the probability x 9 is equal 
to 1 given i know the parameter p

29
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
times the probability of p given i know

30
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,040
eight years of loss data and i 
integrate over the parameter p

31
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:19,520
okay this is the definition of the predictive 
distribution and notice in particular we have  

32
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:28,960
sitting right here the posterior distribution this 
is my updated information about the parameter p  

33
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:40,720
given i have observed eight years of data so let's 
uh collect what we know so far we have a prior  

34
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,720
distribution which was given to us in 
the problem uniform between 0 and 0.5

35
00:04:49,920 --> 00:05:04,160
the prior is pi p which is uniform between 0 
and 0.5 i'm going to draw the prior over here  

36
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:13,120
here's my parameter p start at zero this thing 
is bounded at 0.5 and of course if it's uniform  

37
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,000
what that means let's see what color should i use 
for the prior the prior will henceforth be red

38
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,760
it is every value equally likely that's the prior

39
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,840
well then i have a customer with 
eight years of consecutive losses  

40
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,200
so i need to compute the posterior

41
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,280
this is pi of p given x1 is the loss 
all the way through x8 is a loss

42
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
okay so we use what we know 
about bayesian methods in general  

43
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,160
this posterior of course is going to 
be proportional to the probability  

44
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:14,800
year one was a loss given p times year two 
three four five six seven eight was a loss

45
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
times the prior

46
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:32,640
and of course this is p times times p 
there are eight of them times the prior  

47
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,400
which is 2. the posterior will 
be proportional to p to the 8th  

48
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,840
power and in the textbook it goes through 
how to find the normalizing constant  

49
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,000
because we know that the posterior is a density 
and must integrate to 1. so in fact the posterior

50
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:09,520
is equal to nine times point five to the 
negative ninth power times p to the eighth

51
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
all right let's take a look at that here  

52
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,360
this by the way is the posterior and this is what 
i'm going to plug in for the predictive density

53
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:34,160
and if this is proportional to p to the eighth 
when p is small near zero this is going to be  

54
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:43,840
very small and when p is larger this is going to 
be larger the posterior looks something like this

55
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:57,840
and that makes sense because this person after 
all has had eight consecutive years of losses

56
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,320
so probably for this person they have a much 
larger probability of experiencing a loss they  

57
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:14,720
just seem to be a riskier customer and so we 
have finally uh set the table for solving the  

58
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,080
problem that we need to solve we want to ask 
ourselves what is the probability that this  

59
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:27,920
person after eight years of losses will experience 
at least one more loss next year all we need to do  

60
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:35,840
now that we have our posterior is integrate 
the probability of one more loss given p  

61
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,640
times the posterior dp we need to 
evaluate this predictive distribution  

62
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:52,480
so doing that of course probability next year 
is at least the loss given the last eight is the  

63
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:04,160
integral 0 to 0.5 the probability of one 
more loss given p times the posterior

64
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,840
dp

65
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:19,200
the probability of one more loss 
that's just p the posterior is nine  

66
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:29,600
times .5 to the negative ninth power times p to 
the eighth and i integrate this over d over p  

67
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,520
so we can move some constants out front i get 
a nine times a point five to the negative ninth  

68
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:45,920
power i have a p to the nine and i integrate 
that so of course i get one over ten times p  

69
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,640
to the tenth power and i evaluate this 
expression between point five and zero

70
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,680
so we collect some terms i'll get the nine out 
front bring the ten over of course i have point  

71
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,720
five to the negative nine and that's going to be 
multiplied by 0.5 to the 10. so only a 0.5 remains  

72
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,160
then when i plug in 0 the 
whole expression is equal to 0.  

73
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,800
so this is 0.5 over times 9 
over 10 which is equal to 0.45

74
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,040
and let's think about that number in 
the context of the problem we've already  

75
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,320
established this was a very risky customer 
they've had eight consecutive years of losses  

76
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,640
even though my prior distribution thought 
the probability someone would get a loss  

77
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:51,360
was evenly distributed between 0 and 0.5 for this 
risky customer after 8 years of losses i'm pretty  

78
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:59,840
sure their probability of a loss is much higher so 
i calculate the bayesian predictive distribution  

79
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:08,160
which is defined as we've shown and sure 
enough we find the probability that this person  

80
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:16,480
should experience yet another loss is on the 
large side of this range is 0.45 so what we've  

81
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,720
seen in this problem once again is how to move 
from a prior belief updating that through data  

82
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,400
to construct a posterior and now using that 
posterior to move to a predictive distribution  

83
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:40,320
to say something about what we think the next 
observed variable might look like thank you
