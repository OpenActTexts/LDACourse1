Hello and welcome back. My name is Brian Hartman and I am an associate professor at Brigham Young University.
This slide reviews grouped data from the first video in this section. If you would like to review this slide, please pause the presentation or go back to the earlier video. 
Censoring occurs when we observe only a limited value of an observation. Suppose that X represents a loss due to an insured event and that u is a known censoring point. If observations are censored from the right (or from above), then we observe Y equals the minimum of X and u. In this case, u may represent the upper limit of coverage for an insurer. The loss exceeds the amount u but the insurer does not have in its records the amount of the actual loss. If observations are censored from the left (or from below), then we observe the maximum of X and u. Let u represents the upper limit of coverage but now Y − u represents the amount that a reinsurer is responsible for. If the loss X is less than u, then Y equals 0, no loss for the reinsurer. If the loss X is greater than or equal to u, then Y equals X – u and represents the reinsurer’s retained claims.
In this case, you can use the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Let t sub one through t sub c be distinct points at which an event of interest occurs, or non-censored losses, and let s sub j be the number of events at time point t sub j. Further, the corresponding “risk set” is the number of observations that are active at an instant just prior to t sub j. Using notation, the risk set is R sub j equals the sum of the indicators. With this notation, the product-limit estimator of the distribution function is as follows. Greenwood in 1926 derived the formula for the estimated variance.
