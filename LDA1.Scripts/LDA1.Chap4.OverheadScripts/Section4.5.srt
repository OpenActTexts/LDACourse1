Hello and welcome back. My name is Brian Hartman
and I am an associate professor at Brigham

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,290
Young University.
This slide reviews grouped data from the first

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,610
video in this section. If you would like to
review this slide, please pause the presentation

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,609
or go back to the earlier video.
Censoring occurs when we observe only a limited

5
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:25,600
value of an observation. Suppose that X represents
a loss due to an insured event and that u

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,240
is a known censoring point. If observations
are censored from the right (or from above),

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,489
then we observe Y equals the minimum of X
and u. In this case, u may represent the upper

8
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:43,730
limit of coverage for an insurer. The loss
exceeds the amount u but the insurer does

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,929
not have in its records the amount of the
actual loss. If observations are censored

10
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:55,129
from the left (or from below), then we observe
the maximum of X and u. Let u represents the

11
00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:00,429
upper limit of coverage but now Y − u represents
the amount that a reinsurer is responsible

12
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:07,090
for. If the loss X is less than u, then Y
equals 0, no loss for the reinsurer. If the

13
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:13,510
loss X is greater than or equal to u, then
Y equals X – u and represents the reinsurer’s

14
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,460
retained claims.
In this case, you can use the Kaplan-Meier

15
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:25,460
estimator. Let t sub one through t sub c be
distinct points at which an event of interest

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,950
occurs, or non-censored losses, and let s
sub j be the number of events at time point

17
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,021
t sub j. Further, the corresponding “risk
set” is the number of observations that

18
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:44,320
are active at an instant just prior to t sub
j. Using notation, the risk set is R sub j

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,611
equals the sum of the indicators. With this
notation, the product-limit estimator of the

20
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:56,450
distribution function is as follows. Greenwood
in 1926 derived the formula for the estimated

21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,280
variance.
