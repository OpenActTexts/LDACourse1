Hello and welcome back. My name is Brian Hartman
and I am an associate professor at Brigham

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,849
Young University.
An outcome is potentially truncated when the

3
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,370
availability of an observation depends on
the outcome. In insurance, it is common for

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,520
observations to be truncated from the left
(or below) at d when the amount observed is

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,770
Y which is equal to x minus d only when x
is greater than or equal to d. In this case,

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,940
d may represent the deductible associated
with an insurance coverage. If the insured

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,720
loss is less than the deductible, then the
insurer does not observe the loss. If the

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:43,190
loss exceeds the deductible, then the excess
X minus d is the claim that the insurer covers.

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,870
Observations may also be truncated from the
right (or above) at d when the amount observed

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:55,130
is x only when x is less than d. Classic examples
of truncation from the right include X as

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:01,170
a measure of distance of a star. When the
distance exceeds a certain level d, the star

12
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,430
is no longer observable.
This slide can look intimidating, I am sorry

13
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,389
about that. Letâ€™s talk through it. The probability
of an observation ending up in the jth interval

14
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:16,299
is just the probability that it is less than
or equal to the top of the interval, F of

15
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:20,420
c sub j, minus the probability that it is
less than or equal to the bottom of the interval,

16
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:27,670
F of c sub j minus 1. The pmf just writes
those formulas more generally. The likelihood

17
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,139
is equal to the product of all the probabilities
and the log-likelihood is just the natural

18
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:37,630
log of the likelihood, or the sum of the log
of the probabilities.

19
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,460
Back to censoring, suppose that X represents
a loss due to an insured event and that u

20
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,380
is a known censoring point. If observations
are censored from the right (or from above),

21
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,859
then we observe Y equals the minimum of X
and u and delta u is the indicator if x is

22
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:59,939
greater than or equal to u. If censoring occurs
so that delta u equals 1, then X is greater

23
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,219
than or equal to u and the likelihood is 1
minus F of u. If censoring does not occur

24
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:12,190
so that delta u equals 0, then X is less than
c sub u and the likelihood is f(y). In notation,

25
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:18,819
the likelihood is at the bottom of the slide.
Now that we have the likelihood for a single

26
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,370
observation, consider a random sample of size
n with a set of potential censoring times.

27
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,569
Then the joint likelihood is just the product
of the individual likelihoods, or the pdf

28
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:38,560
of y sub I for all the uncensored observations
times one minus the cdf of u sub i for all

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,660
the censored observations. Again, the log
likelihood is simply the natural log of the

30
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,019
likelihood.
Truncated data are handled in likelihood inference

31
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,980
via conditional probabilities. Adjust the
likelihood contribution by dividing by the

32
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,640
probability that the variable was observed.
Summarizing, we have the following contributions

33
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,569
to the likelihood for six types of outcomes
in the table at the bottom of the slide.

34
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,290
To combine the likelihoods, we simply multiply
each of the terms from our sample. We can

35
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,670
then take the derivative of the loglikelihood
and set it equal to zero to find the maximum

36
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,300
likelihood estimate.
