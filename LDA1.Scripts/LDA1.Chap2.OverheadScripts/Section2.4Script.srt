Hello!  

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,840
I am Shyamal Kumar from the Department of 
Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University  

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,920
of Iowa. This lecture concerns extensions of 
the (a,b,0) class of frequency distributions. 

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,680
Recall that the (a,b,0)-class of count 
distributions consists of three distributions:  

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,520
Binomial, Poisson, and Negative Binomial. 
While these cater well to many modeling needs,  

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
actuaries need more distributions in practice.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,840
To begin with, the (a,b,0) 
being a two-parameter family  

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,360
is a small subset of the infinite-dimensional 
set of all count distributions.  

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,120
So the need for more distributions in the 
actuarial tool kit should come as no surprise. 

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,760
The following slides concern two natural 
reasons for extending the (a,b,0)-class.  

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,040
In a mathematical sense, these extensions 
are actuarially driven closure requirements  

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,160
on the set of distributions in an actuarial tool 
kit. This latter point will become apparent soon. 

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,800
Actuaries often encounter heterogeneity at 
the population level. A modeling technique  

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,000
is to divide the population into 
homogeneous sub-populations.  

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,880
Actuaries commonly do so for risk 
rating, among other reasons. 

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,120
(a,b,0)-class of distributions often works well 
at the sub-population level, even if not at the  

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,360
population level. For example, two distinct 
binomially distributed sub-populations  

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,720
do not lead to a binomially 
distributed population.  

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,840
The extension this prompts is explained 
graphically in the next slide.

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,480
Consider a portfolio of policies consisting 
of two sub-portfolios with their number of  

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:08,080
policies in the ratio of 2:1. Their respective 
distributions of claims per policy are binomials  

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:16,560
with parameter m equal to two and parameter q 
equal one-fourth and two-thirds, respectively.

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,240
Distributions with support consisting of 
counts zero, one, and two are defined by the  

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,560
probabilities they assign to one and two, which 
allows us to plot them on a graph as shown here.  

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,400
The plotted curve, in black, represents all 
binomials with parameter m equal to two,  

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,560
and the red dots represent the two binomials 
corresponding to the two sub-portfolios.  

27
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,840
A simple calculation shows 
that the green dot represents  

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,640
the count distribution of a randomly 
selected policy from this portfolio.  

29
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:04,080
Notice that since it does not lie on the 
curve, it is not a binomial distribution.

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,880
This example conveys the need for all the 
distributions represented by the points in  

31
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,280
the shaded region interior to the curve, 
the mixtures of the binomials with m=2.  

32
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,360
We saw an actuarial motivation to round out 
the distributions in the actuarial tool chest  

33
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,760
by including their mixtures. Mathematically,  

34
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,280
a mixture distribution is a convex combination 
of its components, with their number being either  

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,000
finite or infinite. Section 2.5 discusses 
the mechanics of working with mixtures.  

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,840
We now present another natural 
extension of a set of distributions.

37
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,640
Employers provide insurance coverage 
to their employees in many countries,  

38
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
leading to redundant coverage for working couples.  

39
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,040
As a result, a proportion of insureds may not 
file any claims on some of their policies. 

40
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
Such market realities,  

41
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,280
among others, create an out-sized proportion of 
zero claims which is ill-fitted by the standard  

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,880
parametric families of distributions, 
including those of the (a,b,0) class. 

43
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Modifying a probability mass 
function p as shown here,  

44
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,440
with the resulting probability of zero counts 
equal to q0, is called its zero-modification.  

45
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,840
And such modifications extend a set of 
distributions by adding the extra parameter  

46
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,200
q0, enabling accommodation of 
any probability for zero counts.  

47
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,360
Moreover, the zero-modification specified 
aligns with the insurance market realities. 

48
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:03,440
Zero-modification of a distribution, with q0 equal 
to 0, results in its zero-truncated version. In  

49
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,400
other words, the zero-truncated version 
is the conditional distribution of counts  

50
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,880
given at least one count, which is of 
independent actuarial interest as well.

51
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,720
A noteworthy feature of zero modification is that 
the ratio of successive probabilities beyond zero  

52
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,320
remains unchanged. The identical 
shifts of the probabilities beyond zero  

53
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,480
in the log-plot of the probability mass 
functions of zero-modified versions  

54
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,840
from its underlying confirms the above invariance.

55
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,040
An (a,b,0) distribution satisfies the displayed 
recurrence for values of k starting from zero.  

56
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,440
The invariance described in the previous 
slide implies that a zero-modified version  

57
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,440
of an (a,b,0) distribution satisfies the same 
recurrence but for values beginning from one. 

58
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,480
The (a,b,1) class of distributions consists 
of those that satisfy the above recurrence  

59
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,160
for values beginning from one.  

60
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:19,360
This class is parameterized by p0, a, and b, with 
p1 chosen to make the total probability one. 

61
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,480
Clearly, modified versions of (a,b,0) 
distributions belong to the (a,b,1)-class.  

62
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,160
A natural question to ask is if all of the members  

63
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,080
of the (a,b,1) class are zero-modified 
versions of (a,b,0) distributions. 

64
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,440
To answer this question, we note that when a is 
positive, the constraint on b is dependent on the  

65
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:55,120
lowest value of k at which the recurrence relation 
holds. So when we move from (a,b,0) to (a,b,1),  

66
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:07,520
the constraint relaxes from a+b>0 to 
a+b/2>0, which enlarges the parameter space.  

67
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,720
This enlargement allows for zero modified 
versions of extended truncated negative binomials  

68
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,800
and logarithmic distribution. These are not 
zero-modified versions of (a,b,0) distributions.

69
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,840
In the exercise below, you would 
get to test your understanding  

70
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,800
of the (a,b,1) class of distributions.  

71
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,720
Thank you!
