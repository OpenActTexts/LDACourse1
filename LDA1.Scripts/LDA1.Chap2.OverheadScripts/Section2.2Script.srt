00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:02,057
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:03,592
My name is Michelle Xia.

3
00:00:03,592 --> 00:00:07,672
And I am an associate professor at Northern Illinois University.

4
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:12,034
In the previous lecture, we have learned the basic frequency distributions

5
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:14,359
for modeling claim counts.

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:19,021
In this lecture, I am going to introduce the (a, b, 0) class of distributions

7
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:23,300
and show that the Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial distributions

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,467
we learned in the previous lecture all belong to this class.

9
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:32,055
We first introduce the definition and properties of

10
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:34,726
the (a, b, 0) class of distributions.

11
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:40,034
For the definition, a count distribution is
a member of the (a, b, 0) class

12
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:44,034
if its probabilities pk satisfy the recursive formula that,

13
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:50,020
for any k from the support, the ratio of pk and p(k-1) equals

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,017
the sum of a constant "a" and a constant "b" divided by k.

15
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:58,461
Only three distributions are members of the (a, b, 0) class:

16
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:02,287
the Poisson distribution with the constant "a" equals 0,

17
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:05,597
the binomial distribution with "a" smaller than 0,

18
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:09,608
and the negative binomial distribution with "a" larger than 0.

19
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:13,871
For the (a, b, 0) class, the recursive expression given above

20
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:19,152
provides a computationally efficient way to generate the probabilities pk.

21
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:23,232
In addition, the recursive formulation allows us to

22
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:25,700
introduce modifications to the distributions.

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,100
In particular, in insurance, the treatment
of zero claims 

24
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,600
often requires special adjustments

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,634
and the (a,b,0) structure allows us to readily accommodate these adjustments.

26
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:42,134
We will introduce such modifications later in Section 2.5.

27
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:48,134
For the three examples of (a, b, 0) frequency distributions,

28
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:51,500
we can obtain the corresponding recursive expressions

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
based on their probability mass functions, or pmfs.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,434
For the first example, the Poisson distribution,

31
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:02,500
we recall that its probability pk has the
form

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,500
lambda of power k divided by k factorial times the exponential of negative lambda.

33
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,034
Plugging in the expressions of pk and p(k-1),

34
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:17,267
we can obtain their ratio as lambda divided by k.

35
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:20,367
Thus, the Poisson distribution belongs to the (a, b, 0) class

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,034
with "a" equals 0, "b" equals lambda

37
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:29,267
and the probability of "0", p0, equals
the exponential of negative lambda.

38
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,767
For the binomial distribution, we can show

39
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:37,100
that the constant "a" equals -q divided by (1-q),

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:45,267
"b" equals (m+1) times q divided by (1-q), and p0 equals (1-q) of power m.

41
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:48,767
Similarly, we can obtain the recursive expression

42
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:51,267
for the negative binomial distribution,

43
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:55,767
and verify that the constant "a" equals
beta divided by (1+beta),

44
00:02:55,767 --> 00:03:00,934
"b" equals (r-1) times beta divided by (1+beta),

45
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:04,767
and p0 equals (1+beta) of power -r.

46
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,934
Using the above recursive formulas,

47
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:11,100
we can generate and modify the probabilities

48
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,267
for the three frequency distributions
when we know the parameter values.

49
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,767
In this section, you learn how to define

50
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:22,267
the (a, b, 0) class of frequency distributions

51
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:24,800
by deriving the recursive expressions

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,300
based on the probability mass functions.

53
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,800
We then discuss the importance of the recursive relationship

54
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,800
underpinning the (a, b, 0) class of frequency distributions.

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Finally, we identify conditions under which

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,300
this general class reduces to each of

57
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,800
the binomial, Poisson,
and negative binomial distributions.

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,034
Based on the recursive expressions we derive

59
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:53,734
for the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions,

60
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,734
we can generate the probability mass functions

61
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:58,500
when we know the parameter values.

62
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
The exercise below shows how to generate Poisson

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,400
and negative binomial probabilities in R using the recursive formulas.
