Hello! I am Shyamal Kumar from the Department
of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:14,980
University of Iowa. In this lecture, I will
talk on the goodness of fit problem. 

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,020
We have discussed three basic frequency distributions,
along with their extensions through zero modification

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:27,560
and mixing. Nevertheless, such distributions
remain a small subset of the class of all

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,710
possible frequency distributions. 

6
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:37,679
Hence, despite methods for efficiently estimating
the unknown parameters when the model is correct,

7
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,199
the fitted distribution need not be a good
representation of the underlying distribution

8
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:49,559
when the latter is far from the class of distributions
used for modeling. Determining if this is

9
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,179
the case is the goodness of fit problem. 

10
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:58,379
Below we present one statistical test - based
on the Pearson's chi-square test statistic

11
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,330
- to check for the appropriateness of the
fitted distribution as a model for the observed

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:12,850
data. We do so through an example based on
Singaporean auto insurance data. 

13
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:20,810
In 1993, a portfolio of 7,483 auto insurance
policies from a major Singaporean insurance

14
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:27,470
company had the distribution of accidents
per policy as given in the displayed table.

15
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:33,109
The observed maximum number of accidents per
policy was three, and on average, there were

16
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:38,909
about 70 accidents per 1,000 policies. 

17
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,909
Consider an actuary who is evaluating the
Poisson model for this data. 

18
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,770
The first step would be to fit the Poisson
model to this data, and for this, one can

19
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:57,460
employ the maximum likelihood method for estimating
the Poisson mean. Doing so would result in

20
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:04,369
the fitted Poisson mean equal to the sample
mean of about 0.069. 

21
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:10,110
Next, one would partition the non-negative
integers into cells or bins such that the

22
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:18,390
expected number of counts in at least 80%
of the cells, for the sample size of 7,483,

23
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,880
is above 5. 

24
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:30,081
In our case, it is natural to have four singleton
cells for counts 0, 1, 2, and 3 and a cell

25
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:36,610
for counts greater than 3. The table displayed
gives for each cell the observed and fitted

26
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,100
counts derived using the fitted Poisson.  

27
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,690
It is natural to ask, is the Poisson model
a good fit? 

28
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:52,571
To evaluate the fit, we will use the shown
Pearson's chi-square statistic. Chi-square

29
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:58,910
refers to its limiting distribution if the
Poisson model is correct. Its degrees of freedom

30
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:08,220
equals the number of cells minus one minus
the number of estimated parameters. In our

31
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:16,720
example, we estimated one parameter, lambda,
and have five cells, and hence the degrees

32
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
of freedom equals three. 

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,700
For the data given the Pearson's chi-square
statistic equals about 42, while even the

34
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:34,770
99th percentile of chi-square with three degrees
of freedom is below 12. Hence, we deem the

35
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:41,650
Poisson model to be an inadequate representation
of the underlying data. 

36
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:49,790
In the exercise below, you would evaluate
the adequacy instead of the larger zero-modified

37
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,430
Poisson model. 

38
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,030
Thank you!
