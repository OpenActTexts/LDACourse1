00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,270
Welcome back to this video on an Introduction
to Analytics.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,890
Hi, my name is Paul Johnson. I am a lecturer
in the Wisconsin School of Business at the

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,900
University of Wisconsin-Madison.
And in this video, I am going to introduce

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,160
the Wisconsin Property Fund, an example that
we will be using throughout this course.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,360
OVERHEAD 1 - Wisconsin Property Fund

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,890
In the US State of Wisconsin, the insurance
regulator, known as the Office of the Insurance

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,700
Commissioner, administers an insurance pool
for state and local government agencies. The

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,710
pool is called the Local Government Property
Insurance Fund, sometimes known through the

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,821
acronym LGPIF, and that we will call the Wisconsin
Property Fund.

10
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:54,880
This fund has offered since 1911 and provides
insurance on property such as government buildings,

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,430
schools, libraries, and motor vehicles.

12
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,899
The policyholders in the fund consist of over
a thousand local government entities that

13
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,450
include counties, cities, towns, villages,
school districts, and library boards.

14
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,350
OVERHEAD 2 - LGPIF Policyholder A

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,570
These policyholders are not people but rather
government agencies. So, this is fund is closer

16
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,250
to commercial insurance, or insurance for
businesses, rather than personal insurance

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,860
which is insurance for people.

18
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Just to get a feel for what we are insuring,
here is the first of two examples. This is

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,619
a picture of an elementary school building
which is part of a school district.

20
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:44,939
Specifically, it is part of the Madison Metropolitan
School District that has 98 buildings, 18

21
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:52,140
major pieces of equipment, and 630 properties
in the open. The open properties include benches,

22
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,869
playsets, goals, and so forth. The insured
value of the property is $640 millions of

23
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,869
USD.

24
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,570
OVERHEAD 3 - LGPIF Policyholder B

25
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,300
But, the Madison Metropolitan School District
is not the largest of the approximately one

26
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:17,140
thousand insureds. That honor goes to the
city of Green Bay that has insured value of

27
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:26,970
approximately $2.4 billions of USD. Of its
118 sites, here is a picture of Lambeau Field.

28
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,590
This is the stadium in which a professional
American football team, the Green Bay Packers,

29
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,629
plays.

30
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:40,290
Interestingly, because of its world-wide reknown,
the fund has a separate terrorism reinsurance

31
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,651
coverage for this property.

32
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:44,750
OVERHEAD 4 - Property Fund

33
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:52,440
To give you a feel for the size, the fund
receives approximately $25 million in premiums

34
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:00,640
each year and provides insurance coverage
for about $75 billion.

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,660
The fund offers three major groups of insurance
coverage: building and contents, construction

36
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,720
equipment, and motor vehicles.

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,490
For building and contents, the fund covers
all property losses except those resulting

38
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:22,830
from flood, earthquake, wear and tear, extremes
in temperature, mold, war, nuclear reactions,

39
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,260
and embezzlement or theft by an employee.

40
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,489
OVERHEAD 5 - Claims Frequency - R Code

41
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:35,019
Now that we have described a meaningful business
context, let's move directly to the analytics.

42
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:40,800
We want to show how statistical code can be
used to provide some useful results for understanding

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,430
the business of insurance.

44
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:50,520
Here are 4 lines of code.
In the first, we read in the the data, externally

45
00:03:50,520 --> 00:04:03,090
stored in a "csv", for "comma-separated-value"
format, into an internal data frame, in this

46
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:10,810
case called "Insample".
Next, we restrict attention to a subset of

47
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:19,800
year 2010 experience. It is common to examine
insurance data on a yearly basis to separate

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:26,879
the investigation of trends.
In the last two lines, we summarize the data.

49
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,889
Instead of showing the direct result from
these commands, in the next overhead we present

50
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,819
the output in a format one might use to make
business decisions.

51
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:38,830
OVERHEAD 6 - Claims Frequency (2010)

52
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:48,379
From the frequency table, we learn several
things. For example, the table shows 1,110

53
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:56,740
policyholders who have 1,377 claims. Of these
claims, almost two-thirds of the policyholders

54
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:07,979
did not have any claims, 18.8% had one claim
and remaining 17.5% had more than one claim.

55
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:13,349
From the summary statistics, we learn that
one policyholder with the highest number recorded

56
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:24,050
239 claims. Further digging shows that this
was the Madison Metropolitan School district.

57
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,939
Many of these claims were from minor damage
such as broken windows caused by misbehaving

58
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:35,289
children. Further, the average number of claims
for this sample was 1.24.

59
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:36,289
REVIEW

60
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:40,599
This provide just a brief glimpse of the data.
But, let's pause for a moment to give you

61
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:43,279
time to practice the tools introduce so far.

62
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,610
I hope that you found this overview of Wisconsin
Property Fund to be useful.

63
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:51,101
In this video, we examined the frequency of
claims for the fund. In the next video, you

64
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:56,839
will learn how to analyze claim amounts, also
known as the severity of claims.

65
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,339
Thanks for watching!
