00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:07,740
Welcome to the tutorial on an Introduction
to Loss Data Analytics.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,871
My name is Yvonne Chueh. I am a professor
at Central Washington University. Today, I

3
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:31,239
am going to discuss some key points on the
relevance of analytics.

4
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,550
In this course and book, we are considering
risk management and insurance techniques,

5
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,550
so I want to emphasize the importance of insurance.

6
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,280
OVERHEAD 1 - Relevance of Insurance

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,940
Insurance is an important economic activity.
A common method for measuring the extent of

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:02,400
activity is to examine the insurance premiums.
By this measure, insurance related activities

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,259
comprise about 6.3% of world GDP, or gross
domestic product. As one example, the country

10
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:15,700
with the highest percentage is Japan, where
insurance premiums accounted for 11.2% of

11
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:25,600
GDP. As another example, in the US insurance
actities accounted for 7.5% of GDP.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,020
Without going into details, insurance is important
for businesses and governments.

13
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:39,030
On an individual level, insurance touches
the lives of most people. For example, almost

14
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:46,639
everyone owning a home has insurance to protect
themselves in the event of a fire, hailstorm,

15
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:54,399
or some other calamitous event. As another
example, almost every country requires some

16
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,329
type of insurance for those driving a car.

17
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:03,670
OVERHEAD 2 - Analytics and Loss Data

18
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:11,170
Because insurance is a big business, it is
not surprising that insurers employ analytics

19
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:20,319
in the same manner as other large corporations.
Virtually every large firm uses analytics

20
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,150
extensively in sales and marketing, compensation
and productivity analysis, as well as financial

21
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:32,450
forecasting. For example, in sales and marketing,
analytics is used to:

22
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:39,239
☻ Predict customer behavior/needs
☻ Anticipate customer reactions to promotions/rate

23
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,340
changes
☻ Manage acquisition costs such as online

24
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,340
sales.

25
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,680
Firms use analytics extensively and it is
highly likely that your role in a firm will

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,920
involve analytics in some capacity.

27
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,879
So, we could introduce analytics from one
of many perspectives, for example sales data

28
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:08,360
or returns on investments. In this course,
to keep a firm tie to the insurance industry,

29
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,440
we focus on loss data, also known as insurance
claims or insurance amounts.

30
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,819
OVERHEAD 3 - What is Analytics?

31
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:27,689
All firms use analytics, and insurers are
no exception. Moreover, insurance is a data-driven

32
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:34,459
industry, meaning that analytics is particularly
important. Analytics is a key to deriving

33
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,819
information from data.

34
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:43,079
But what precisely do we mean when say analytics?
For contrast, we might use

35
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:50,829
☻ "business intelligence". An old phrase
used by those in operations research. Here,

36
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:57,970
the focus is on processes of collecting data,
often through databases and data warehouses.

37
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,870
Or, we could use
☻ "business analytics", a description used

38
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:11,150
by many modern business schools. It suggests
utilizing tools and methods for statistical

39
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:18,050
analyses of data. Another is
☻ "data science", used by many departments

40
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:24,670
of statistics. This can encompass broader
applications in many scientific domains.

41
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:32,250
For our purposes, we use the term "Analytics"
to mean simply the process of using data to

42
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,050
make decisions.

43
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,400
Specifically, this process involves gathering
data, understanding models of uncertainty,

44
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,740
making general inferences, and communicating
results.

45
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,090
OVERHEAD 4 - Insurance Processes

46
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:57,690
We will be using insurance data to introduce
analytics and so it is helpful to think about

47
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:03,140
how this data is generated by insurance processes.

48
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:09,150
In a “micro” oriented view, we can think
specifically about what happens to a contract

49
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:17,400
at various stages of its existence. Here is
a graph that symbolizes the timeline of a

50
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,870
typical insurance policy.

51
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:27,169
It marks when a policy starts with a premium
payment. Policies that we focus on, such as

52
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:34,729
motor vehicle, are typically short-term contracts
such as 6 months or a year but that also typically

53
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:42,389
are renewed, resulting in another premium
payment. Also marked on the graph are claim

54
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:50,220
occurrences, and there may be more than one
of them even within a single short-term period.

55
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,410
REVIEW

56
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:58,931
I hope that you found this overview of the
relevance of analytics to be useful. In this

57
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:02,940
section, we learned how to:

58
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,700
☻ Summarize the importance of insurance
to consumers and the economy

59
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,509
☻ Describe analytics
☻ Identify data generating events associated

60
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,770
with the timeline of a typical insurance contract

61
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,949
Thanks for watching.
