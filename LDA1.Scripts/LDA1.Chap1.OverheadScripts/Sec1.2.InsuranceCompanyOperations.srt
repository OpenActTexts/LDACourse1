00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,850
Welcome back to the tutorial on an Introduction
to Loss Data Analytics.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:10,690
Hello, my name is Jed Frees, an emeritus professor
with University of Wisconsin and Australian

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:16,250
National University. In this video, I am going
to discuss some key points on insurance company

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,250
operations.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,140
OVERHEAD 1 - Insurance Company Operations

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,119
In the prior video, we discussed how claims
data are likely to come from the lifetime

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,210
of a policy. For analysts, it is also important
to see how these data may be used in the firm

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,260
operations.

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,150
From an Insurer’s viewpoint, to operate
they need ways of bringing money in, paying

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:45,070
it out, managing costs, and making sure that
the insurer has enough money to meet obligations.

11
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:51,390
To make this happen, insurers aggregate detailed
insurance processes into larger operational

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,420
units. Here is a list of the five units commonly
used within the insurance industry.

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:03,160
The first unit is about when the insurers
initiates the policy. Here, analysts are involved

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,549
in determining an appropriate price for a
risk. Before the pricing, risks are grouped

15
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,840
into appropriate categories that are similar
to one another. "Adverse selection" is a common

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,689
phenomena in insurance such as has a policyholder
with a risky tendency, like a history of alcoholism,

17
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:25,820
that the insurer is unaware of. Identifying
adverse selection is an important component

18
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,340
of pricing risks.

19
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,380
Pricing is also important at the renewal of
insurance. Many personal insurance contracts,

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,890
such as auto and homeowners, have relatively
short terms such as 6 months or a year but

21
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,240
are typically renewed. In this way, the effective
length of the relationship between policyholder

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,810
and insurer is much longer than the contract
term and insurers want to retain customers

23
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,810
deemed profitable.

24
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,110
OVERHEAD 2 - Insurance Company Operations

25
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,810
Pricing is most visibile to the public but
an equally important part of insurance company

26
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:05,090
operations is paying, and managing, claims.
Insurers use analytics for early identification

27
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,200
of costly claims so they can field the appropriate
teams to pay, and in some cases, litigate

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,180
responsibility for claims. They also use analytics
to manage mischief, as fraud can raise costs

29
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,400
for all parties.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,980
Another unit of insurance operations is that
of setting aside money for future obligations,

31
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,010
a process known as reserving. Medical costs
associated with some lines of business such

32
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:38,530
as workers compensation can take many years
to evolve. As another example, claims that

33
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,599
associatied general obligations and liabilities
of firms can also take many years to evolve

34
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,049
due to extensive legal activities. These are
two examples where analysts

35
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:53,650
☻ Predict future obligations
☻ Quantify the uncertainty of the estimates

36
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,400
☻ Match projections of obligations to income
streams

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,260
The fifth and final operational unit regards
determining the amount of money to be held

38
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,410
to keep an insurer financial stability, the
solvency, and the business units that can

39
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:14,440
most productively use the money, capital allocation.
Analysts in this domain work to decide appropriate

40
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,940
level of necessary capital and to help manage
external stakeholders’ expectations.

41
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,209
OVERHEAD 3 - Operations – Initiating Insurance

42
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,970
Analysts work extensively with pricing insurance
at the initial contract. The public cares

43
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:34,120
about pricing and so this is the focus of
our introduction to insurance analytics.

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,159
But, setting the price of an insurance good
can be a perplexing problem. We are bit more

45
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,599
familiar with pricing in other sectors. For
example,

46
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,040
☻ In manufacturing, the cost of a good is
(relatively) known, making pricing simpler.

47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,690
☻ In other areas of financial services,
market prices are available.

48
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,030
In many lines of insurance, start with an
expected cost, add “margins” to account

49
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,180
for the product’s riskiness, expenses incurred
in servicing the product, and a profit/surplus

50
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,420
allowance for the insurance company.

51
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,689
with this structure, getting the expected
cost is a key ingredient. Especially in automobile

52
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:19,560
and homeowners insurance, analytics to sharpen
the market by making the calculation of the

53
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,449
distribution more precise.

54
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:27,310
In this course, we build the foundations.
Later, you will see that multivariate pricing

55
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,530
strategies routinely employ advanced statistical
methods such as generalized linear modeling.

56
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,440
OVERHEAD 4 - Big Data

57
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,940
Much of the gain in popularity in advancing
analytics in the recent years is due to increased

58
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:49,020
willingness to use data to make business decisions.
Some call this movement "Big Data," referring

59
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,740
to the increasing capacity and computational
abilities of computers, availability of new

60
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,530
and innovative sources of data, and advanced
algorithms that can detect patterns in insurance

61
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,750
activities that were previously unknown.

62
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:11,199
Traditionally, insurers used only information
reported by policyholders on application forms,

63
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,100
combined with selected external sources. For
example, for decades auto insurers used police

64
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:24,000
reports to price automobile insurance and
medical exam results for life insurance.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,940
Now, there is interest in collecting more
information about policyholders. Some credit

66
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,380
the interest in using more and different data
to Progressive Insurance who used credit scores

67
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:42,580
for pricing automobile insurance. From an
analyst’s viewpoint, these additional sources

68
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,090
have proven to be significant from predictive
and economic viewpoints.

69
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,930
There are serious questions as what types
of data are ethically permissible for insurers

70
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,000
to use. For example, it has long been held
that use of racial and ethnic information

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,949
is illegal in most jurisdictions. The resulting
debates are important.

72
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,750
Our position is not that analysts should dictate
whether or not use of information should be

73
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:17,940
restricted or prohibited. Rather, these considerations
involve policy choices that should also involve

74
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,430
legal and economic scholars, as well as government
representatives and advocates for the industry

75
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,860
and for consumers. Analysts can make important
contributions to these discussions by quantifying

76
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,770
the financial impact of policy alternatives.

77
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,900
REVIEW

78
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:45,550
I hope that you found this overview of insurance
company operations to be useful. In this section,

79
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,550
we learned how to:

80
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,990
☻ Describe five major operational areas
of insurance companies.

81
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,210
☻ Identify the role of data and analytics
opportunities within the pricing area.

82
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,210
Thanks for watching!
