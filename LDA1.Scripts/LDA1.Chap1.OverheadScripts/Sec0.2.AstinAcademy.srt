Hello, I am Miyuki Ebisaki, a member of ASTIN
board.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,780
Thank you for volunteered for this project,
a short course of Loss Data Analytics, which

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,740
forms a part of ASTIN Academy.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,769
I would like to give a short explanation about
ASTIN, and what ASTIN would like to achieve

5
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:26,239
through ASTIN Academy.

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:33,149
ASTIN is a well-established worldwide leading
forum of risk and actuarial professionals

7
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,460
of non-life insurance industry. Created as
the first Section of the International Actuarial

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:45,840
Association (IAA) in 1957.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,600
ASTIN has evolved and broadened its boundaries
to areas ranging from the well-established

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,530
Ratemaking and Reserving to more contemporary
Risk and Capital Management, and newly emerging

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,300
Data Science and Machine Learning.

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,730
This table shows how ASTIN plans to develop
actuarial education for audience of beginners

13
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:17,730
and professionals, with lectures given by
professionals and authorities.

14
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:27,140
We have held colloquia for fifty times in
sixty years. In recent years, we introduced

15
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:34,080
a series of specialised workshops, with the
aim of bridging the gap between academia and

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,590
industry.

17
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:43,630
ASTIN plans to produce a series of online
masterclasses on a wide range of non-life

18
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:53,350
insurance topics. The last but the most important
development is education for beginners conveyed

19
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:02,430
by authorities. It is ASTIN Academy to fill
in the missing piece.

20
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:09,950
The mission of the ASTIN Academy is to provide
high quality free educational materials in

21
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:17,440
non-life insurance to actuarial students across
the world. The Academy is committed to open

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,940
course development under Creative Commons
license and seeks innovation in teaching methodologies

23
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,160
and application of technology.

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Letâ€™s build the future of actuarial education
together.
