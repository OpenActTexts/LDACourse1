00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Hi, I'm Paul Johnson.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,070
I'm a lecturer in the
Wisconsin School of Business

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,620
at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,590
And I want to take a
couple of minutes to show

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,705
you how to navigate
this online tutorial,

6
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:18,210
exploring the foundations
of loss data analytics.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,930
It is expected that it'll take

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,420
the average person
about six hours

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,099
to complete this tutorial.

10
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:27,305
But that's only an estimate.

11
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:28,910
You're encouraged to work through

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,210
this tutorial at your
own pace in a way that

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,370
allows you to fully
understand and be

14
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,980
able to apply the
concepts described here.

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,520
And I'll also say that
this tutorial does assume

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,200
some familiarity in our
statistical programming language.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,480
And if you need to learn about

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,880
bad or get a
refresher about, are.

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,060
There are links in
this tutorial to

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,010
a data cap introduction
to R. Okay,

21
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,110
now as far as how to
actually navigate this,

22
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,880
if you look at the left,

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,739
you'll see a bunch of links
where if you focus here,

24
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:08,545
you could see that
this is chapter one,

25
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:11,305
introduction to LA
stayed analytics.

26
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,229
In time. There'll be
multiple chapters,

27
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,475
so there'll be a chapter to

28
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,040
chapter three and
so on and so forth.

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,810
But for each chapter
there'll be subsections.

30
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,120
And so when I am in right now is

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,835
Section 1.5 of chapter one,

32
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:31,075
which talks about property
find braiding variables.

33
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,265
So I'll use this
as an illustration

34
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:36,400
for what you'll do
in a subsection.

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,895
So the sub-section, we'll
start with video introduction,

36
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:45,860
in which some
individual will have

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,710
a short four to eight
minute video that

38
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,620
summarizes the key
learning objectives

39
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,585
for this subsection.

40
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:57,260
In this case, Professor freeze
will provide an overview

41
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,295
of raided variables for the
Wisconsin property fund.

42
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:04,070
Then, following the video,

43
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,730
there'll be one or
two exercises that

44
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,900
is related to what was
described in the video.

45
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,780
And each of these
exercises are done on

46
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,940
an online learning platform
by data camp so that

47
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,469
you don't need to actually
install R on your device.

48
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,840
I would encourage
you if you plan,

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,460
I do eat further analyses
beyond this tutorial with R,

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,870
that you do download
and install R and use

51
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,295
the code editor RStudio to
be able to work with that.

52
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,410
One of the advantages
of being able to have

53
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,690
already old computer
is you can work

54
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,255
with all kinds of
different R packages.

55
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:51,730
But for the purpose
of this tutorial,

56
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,940
you could just do
it exercise using

57
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,600
the R script that's provided
in a box like this.

58
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,990
Alright, so in this
particular exercise,

59
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,960
we are to modify the function
by var some to include

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,270
the standard
deviation and include

61
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,525
documentation of this
statistic in the table.

62
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:18,335
And so you'll see that there's
blanks in this script.

63
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:20,690
And in exercises like this,

64
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,730
you should fill in the
blanks with what you

65
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,745
think are appropriate R code.

66
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:28,145
And just to illustrate this,

67
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,630
I will type in.

68
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,140
So I'll take this and I will put

69
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,285
in STD for standard deviation,

70
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:44,790
put in an a four here.

71
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,805
And then I'll play it.

72
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:51,610
Not sure here.

73
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:59,215
And then what you could do
is you can run this code.

74
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:02,200
And if there are errors,

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,975
there'll be pointed out to you.

76
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:07,120
So in this line here,

77
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,925
I have this bar

78
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:12,580
that I apparently did it
needed to get rid of.

79
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,820
Okay. But what she could
do was then you can make

80
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,385
the change and you can redo
it and see if it works out.

81
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:22,990
And if you're ever stuck,

82
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,060
you can look for hints or you

83
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,990
can just see what
the solution is.

84
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,110
The idea is that you shouldn't

85
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,819
worry about making mistakes

86
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:33,500
because this is something

87
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,780
that you can do at your own pace.

88
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,780
The most important thing is
to be able to ultimately

89
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,470
enhance your understanding
about lost data analytics.

90
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,905
And just to be clear,

91
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,740
there are other
mistakes in this line

92
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,160
and in what I entered in
this particular exercise.

93
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,660
So I was just trying to give you

94
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,595
an idea of how this worked.

95
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,010
What do you actually
do this exercise,

96
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,390
you'll be able to be a bit more

97
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,910
thoughtful in filling
in the blanks.

98
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,070
And I was for this illustration.

99
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,750
Thanks for watching this video.

100
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,090
I'm navigating this
online tutorial.
