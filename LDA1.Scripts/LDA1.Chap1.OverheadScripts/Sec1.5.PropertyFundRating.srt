00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,360
Welcome back to the tutorial on an Introduction
to Loss Data Analytics.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,670
Hello, my name is Jed Frees, an emeritus professor
at the University of Wisconsin and the Australian

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,330
National University. In this video, I am going
to demonstrate how different characteristics

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,560
may affect our assessment of insurance costs
in the context of the Wisconsin Property Fund.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,800
OVERHEAD 1 - Description of Rating Variables

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,770
Here is a list of available characteristics;
hopefully, these are variables that you think

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,640
might naturally be related to claims outcomes.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,079
It is common to refer to these as rating variables.
Conceptually, these variables may affect the

9
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,579
distribution of insurance outcomes that we
have discussed, the frequency and severity.

10
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:50,950
As they affect these claims distributions,
they affect estimates of insurance costs and

11
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,210
so our determination of rates that one pays
for insurance.

12
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,730
The two approximately continuous variables
are coverage and deductibles.

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,040
To handle their skewness, we focus on logarithmic
transformations. Most rating variables employed

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,790
in the analysis of insurance claims are of
the categorical type. Here, we have entity

15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,400
type, type of credit for smoke alarm, as well
as indicators for no claim credit and presence

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,670
of a fire station. In our analysis, we focus
on the categorical variables.

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,540
OVERHEAD 2 - Claims by Entity Type, Fire Class,
and No Claim Credit

18
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,620
Here are some summary statistics by three
of the four categorical variables, with alarm

19
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,870
credit being deferred to later. As before,
we present simple averages to get a quick

20
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,430
idea of differences in the distributions.

21
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,850
The first thing to notice from the table is
that there is substantial variation in the

22
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,451
frequency and severity by entity type. This
is intuitively plausible; for example, we

23
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:56,610
expect more claims for small villages in comparison
to larger counties. This will imply very different

24
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,100
costs of insurance by entity types.

25
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,390
As anticipated, we see both lower frequency
and lower severity when the policyholder had

26
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:14,090
no claims in the past two years, so that NoClaimCredit
indicator is 1. This is also common in the

27
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,689
analysis of insurance claims, past experience
is often an excellent predictor of current

28
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:22,620
and future behavior.

29
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,849
Somewhat surprising is the higher frequency
and severity for the Fire5 (=1) variable.

30
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:34,930
This is counter-intuitive in that one would
expect lower claim amounts for those policyholders

31
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,889
in areas with better public protection (when
the protection code is five or less). There

32
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:46,110
are at least two possible explanations for
this. One is that policyholders who greater

33
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,480
public protection nearby become more careless.

34
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,530
The second is that there may be a joint effect
that is being masked by our univariate analysis.

35
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,370
For example, it could be that there are many
more Fire5=1 policyholders that are counties

36
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,610
and we have already seen that counties are
more risky compared to other entities. So,

37
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:14,709
the Fire5=1 variable effect is being distorted
by another variable. Or, it may be that areas

38
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:20,870
with better public protection are naturally
higher risk areas; the protection is there

39
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:26,069
because it is thought to be needed and we
have no other variable that indicates this

40
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,650
need.

41
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,400
This emphasizes a major drawback of this type
of presentation. These tables look at the

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,150
effects of each variable in isolation of the
others and so are referred to as a "univariate"

43
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,189
analyses. As another example, you may have
seen "simple linear regression" in your other

44
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:51,989
studies. In any case, you will find any type
of univariate analysis to be very convenient

45
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:57,749
because it is simple to execute and easy to
explain to others. However, it is limiting

46
00:03:57,749 --> 00:04:02,319
in that does not permit an understanding of
the joint effects of variables.

47
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,599
OVERHEAD 3 - Claims by Entity Type, Fire Class,
and No Claim Credit - R Code

48
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,260
Here is the R code for this analysis.

49
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,169
As in prior examples, we used the "subset"
function to split the data set into smaller

50
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,140
pieces of interest and then used the "summaryBy"
function to pull out the relevant summary

51
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,140
statistics.

52
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,289
Because we were interested in so many statistics,
a small function was created to automate the

53
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:21,289
tasks.

54
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,800
OVERHEAD 4 - Claims by Entity Type and Alarm
Credit Category

55
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,000
Here is an analysis of the fourth categorical
variable, Alarm Credits.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,060
When you take a look at the totals by entity,
we see the same counter intuitive results

57
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,800
as we did for the fire protection code. For
example, we would expect to see lower frequency

58
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,960
and severity for 15% alarm credits compared
to no alarm credits.

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,960
In this analysis, we attempted to dig a little
deeper by showing results by entity type.

60
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,020
To illustrate, from this table, we can compare
villages by different levels of alarm credits.

61
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:06,010
Again, for example, comparing 15% to no alarm
credits, we again see the same counter-intuitive

62
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:13,280
results. Villages with 15% alarm credits actually
experience higher frequency and severity compared

63
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,370
to villages without alarm credits.

64
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,420
As before, the explanation could be that we
are missing a hidden variable that causes

65
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:26,470
this behavior. Or, it could be that managers
who purchase expensive alarm systems become

66
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,449
careless and suffer more accidents as a result.

67
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,740
OVERHEAD 5 -Initiating Insurance

68
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,599
These are the types of considerations that
come into play when trying to estimate the

69
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:44,099
cost of insurance that is needed to set insurance
rates.

70
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:49,470
As we have already seen, we have to take care
in choosing the time frame for our data. Based

71
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:58,060
on the 2010 data, we saw that the average
claim is 33,026. However, if we use 2009 data,

72
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,330
we arrive at a very different conclusion,
9,934.

73
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:08,310
From the analysis in this video, we see that
the distribution of claim outcomes varies

74
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:15,729
tremendously by entity type. So, knowing whether
a policyholder is a village, city, or so on

75
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:20,780
is an important determinant of the cost of
insurance. Although we haven't done the analysis

76
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,000
here, you can make a similar case for coverage.
It makes sense that larger risks should have

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,680
larger insurance costs.

78
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,090
What makes less sense is how to handle alarm
credits. If we follow the same logic, then

79
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:40,090
we would estimate the cost of insurance to
be smaller for an insured without an alarm

80
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,830
credit compared to one that has one. This
is really bad - we want to encourage insureds

81
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,259
to invest in protection of their risks. They
should not be discouraged from purchasing

82
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,650
alarm systems by paying more for insurance.

83
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,509
This is just one of the really interesting
questions that we will be able to discuss

84
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:03,300
as we develop our understanding of insurance
analytics.

85
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,919
REVIEW

86
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:13,300
I hope that you found this case study on the
Wisconsin Property Fund to be useful. In this

87
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,190
section, we learned how to:

88
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,489
☻ Describe how insurance events can produce
data of interest to analysts.

89
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:23,220
☻ Produce relevant summary statistics for
each variable.

90
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,660
☻ Describe how these summary statistics
can be used to develop the cost of insurance.

91
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,490
For this case study, we raise a number of
very interesting questions about how to estimate

92
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:39,080
the cost of insurance. Many students will
be surprised that we did not give answers

93
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,469
to these questions. We raised these questions
in part because they are real issues that

94
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:50,840
insurers deal with regularly and often there
is no clean answer. However, a solid discussion

95
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,689
of these issues rests on a good understanding
of the analytics of insurance claims. And

96
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:58,520
this is the focus of this course.

97
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Thanks for watching!
