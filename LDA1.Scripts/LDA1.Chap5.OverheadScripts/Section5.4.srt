Welcome back to the tutorial on aggregate 
loss models. My name is Peng Shi,  

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,400
a professor in the Risk and Insurance department 
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In this  

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,640
video, I am going to introduce a particular 
compound distribution known as Tweedie.
 

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,160
The Tweedie distribution is the basis for what 
is known by insurers as the pure premium model.  

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:39,040
It provides an alternative framework for pricing 
insurance coverage, and as we will show, it does  

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,920
not require decomposing the aggregate losses 
into the frequency and severity components.
 

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,960
The Tweedie distribution is defined as 
a Poisson sum of gamma random variables.  

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:04,080
Specifically, consider the collective 
risk model, S is equal to the sum of Y1  

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:14,000
to YN. Recall that we interpret S as the total 
losses for an insurance system in one period,  

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,040
where N indicates the number of claims, and 
Y indicates the size of the individual claim.  

11
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:35,040
When N is a Poisson with mean λ, and Y is a Gamma 
with shape parameter α and scale parameter θ,  

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:47,200
the distribution of S is known as Tweedie.
One can further extend the model to incorporate  

13
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,840
exposure, and express the aggregate 
losses on a per-exposure basis.  

14
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:03,840
Let ω be the exposure. By dividing by ω, 
we interpret S as the aggregate losses  

15
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:16,240
per unit of exposure. In this case, the frequency 
becomes a Poisson with mean ω times λ, where we  

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:24,880
assume that the number of claims is proportional 
to the exposure. The severity remains the same.
 

17
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,200
The distribution function can be derived 
using the law of total probabilities,  

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,920
thinking of frequency N as a partition 
of sample space. In the calculation,  

19
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:49,840
we use the fact that given frequency N, 
aggregate loss S is a gamma distribution.  

20
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,480
It should be noted that the Tweedie 
distribution has a probability mass at zero,  

21
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:06,000
that is, S=0 when N=0, and an 
otherwise continuous component.
 

22
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,920
If we reparameterize the Tweedie 
distribution using μ, p, and ϕ,  

23
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,000
we could show that for p between 1 and 2, 
the Tweedie distribution belongs to the  

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,360
exponential family. In particular, the mean of 
the distribution is equal to μ, and the variance  

25
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:41,120
of the distribution is a power function 
of the mean. This result suggests that  

26
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,840
techniques for fitting generalized 
linear models are ready to apply.
 

27
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
Let’s use a toy example to 
demonstrate model fitting.  

28
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:04,080
Consider annual medical expenses from a randomly 
selected 5,000 individuals. The histogram  

29
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,600
shows that a significant portion of subjects 
did not incur any expenses over the year.  

30
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,280
For those with positive expenses, the 
distribution is right skewed and heavy tailed.
 

31
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:32,400
To fit a Tweedie distribution in R, we use the 
glm function in the package statmod. In the  

32
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:42,240
estimation, we need to assume power parameter p
is known. For instance, we set it to be 1.2.  

33
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,800
In the glm function, var.power specifies 
the power of the variance function,  

34
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:00,080
and link.power specifies the link function 
for the mean, with zero indicating a log link.  

35
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:10,560
We could further extract the estimates for mean μ 
and dispersion ϕ using the summary() function.
 

36
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,920
We can examine the goodness-of-fit of 
the model using qq plot. The package  

37
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,560
tweedie provides functions that allow 
us to calculate probability, quantiles,  

38
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,680
and also simulate random realizations 
for the Tweedie distribution.  

39
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:44,640
To generate the qq plot, we use function qtweedie 
to obtain the theoretical quantiles of the fitted  

40
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:52,880
Tweedie distribution, and function quantile to 
obtain the empirical quantiles of the data.
 

41
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,800
The qq plot shows a linear relation between 
the theoretical quantiles of the fitted  

42
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,080
Tweedie distribution and empirical 
quantiles of the data. Hence the  

43
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,800
Tweedie distribution fits the data pretty well.
 

44
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,120
To summarize, in this section, we have learned 
how to construct the Tweedie distribution from  

45
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,720
a collective risk model, establish the Tweedie 
distribution as a member of the exponential family  

46
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:38,400
of distributions, and fit Tweedie distribution as 
a generalized linear model. Thanks for watching.
