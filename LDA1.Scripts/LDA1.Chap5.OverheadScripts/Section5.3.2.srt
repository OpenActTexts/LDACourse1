Welcome back to the tutorial on collective
risk model. My name is Peng Shi, a professor

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:13,880
in the Risk and Insurance department at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,610
In this video, I am going to discuss several
numerical strategies for computing the aggregate

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,130
loss distribution from the collective risk
model.

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:34,070
Recall that the aggregate loss follows a compound
distribution, and in general its distribution

6
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:44,500
cannot be derived analytically. We will introduce
three numerical methods: the direct calculation,

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:52,850
the recursive method, and the Monte Carlo
simulation. We illustrate these methods using

8
00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:02,079
R package actuar. The direct calculation involves
the convolution of a distribution, the recursive

9
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:11,270
method avoids convolution and saves some computational
time, and the Monte Carlo simulation approximates

10
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:18,509
the distribution using the empirical cdf.

11
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:26,350
The first method is the direct calculation.
As we see, the calculation involves the n

12
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:34,719
-fold convolution of the severity distribution.
For computing the distribution in Rusing the

13
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:41,490
convolution, the distributions of frequency
N and severity X

14
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:51,659
must be defined on non-negative integers and
have a finite support. Thus, one has to discretize

15
00:01:51,659 --> 00:02:02,209
the severity distribution so that its support
is discrete and finite.

16
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:12,840
Consider an example. The frequency and severity
distributions are given in the table. We observe

17
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:21,819
that the severity outcomes are multiples of
50, so we first discretize its distribution

18
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:32,739
so that it has support of {0,1,2,3,4,5}.

19
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:40,579
We use function aggregateDist in the actuar
package to compute the distribution of the

20
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:50,680
aggregate loss. First one defines the frequency
probability pnand the severity probability

21
00:02:50,680 --> 00:03:05,670
fx. In aggregateDist function, one specifies
method = convolution. Arguments model.freq

22
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:20,980
and model.sev are supplied by pn and fx respectively.
x.scale=50 indicates possible outcomes of

23
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:28,379
the claim amount are multiples of 50.

24
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:38,920
One names the distribution Fs. plot(Fs) shows
the cdf of the aggregate loss. The jumps in

25
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:47,639
the cdf indicates the discreteness of the
aggregate loss, which is anticipated because

26
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:56,060
both frequency and severity distributions
are discrete.

27
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:03,819
The second approach for computing aggregate
loss distribution is the recursive method.

28
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:11,469
To use recursive method, the probability function
for the frequency component has to satisfy

29
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:25,720
relation pn=(a+b/n)pnâˆ’1
for some constants a and b. Similar to direct

30
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:35,139
calculation, the severity distribution must
have a finite support on non-negative integers.

31
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:41,370
For continuous distributions, one needs to
discretize them before using the recursive

32
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:51,000
method. Finally, the method can be extended
to the more general case where the recursive

33
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:03,070
relationship in frequency distribution starts
from n=2 instead of n=1.

34
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:12,180
Consider an example where the number of claims
is Poisson with mean of 5. The distribution

35
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:21,090
of individual claim amount is the same as
the previous example.

36
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:30,100
In R, one specifies method = recursive in
the aggregateDist function to indicate using

37
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:42,410
recursive method. model.freq must be from
either (a,b,0) or (a,b,1) class, i.e. to satisfy

38
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,770
the recursive relationship.

39
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:56,610
The aggregate loss distribution can also be
approximated using the empirical cdf. We could

40
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:05,680
use Monte Carlo simulation to generate a random
sample of the aggregate loss. To do this,

41
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:13,699
one first generates the number of claims.
Given claim count, one generates the amount

42
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:24,009
of loss for each claim. Calculating the total
losses from all claims, we obtain one realization

43
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:32,530
of aggregate loss. A random sample is obtained
by repeating the process for a large number

44
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,949
of times.

45
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:47,460
In this example, we define the frequency distribution
to be a Poisson with lambda 3, and the severity

46
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:59,780
distribution to be a gamma with shape parameter
100, and scale parameter 5. In function aggregateDist,

47
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:12,270
one indicates method = simulation. The plot
of the empirical cdf is based on 2500 realizations

48
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,000
of the aggregate loss.

49
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,770
To summarize, in this section, we have learned
how to compute the aggregate loss distribution

50
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:33,740
using convolution, recursive method, and Monte
Carlo simulation. We have also demonstrated

51
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,089
these numerical strategies in R. Thanks for
watching.
