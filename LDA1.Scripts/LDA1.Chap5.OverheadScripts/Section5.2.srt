00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,680
Welcome back to the tutorial on aggregate loss 
models. My name is Peng Shi, a professor in  

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,280
actuarial science at the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison. In this video,  

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,760
I introduce the individual risk model and discuss 
its application in short-term insurance.
 

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,120
In the introduction, we have learned that 
conceptually an individual risk model examines  

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:36,160
the losses at policy level, and calculates the 
total losses from all individual policies.
 

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,880
In this section, we formally represent 
the model using random variables. Here S  

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:55,360
denotes the total losses of a portfolio of n 
contracts, and Xi, for i=1,…,n, is the loss  

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:03,600
for the ith contract. To emphasize, note that 
the number of contracts is fixed and known.
 

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,320
In this model, we typically assume losses from 
different contracts are independent with each  

10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,720
other, but not necessarily identically 
distributed. This could be due to the  

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,160
different exposures across the contracts. 
Taking homeowner insurance as an example,  

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,200
one could think that the loss distribution 
depends on the value of the property.
 

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,320
One also notes the distribution of Xi  

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:45,040
is often featured with a probability mass 
at zero, that is, for a given policyholder,  

15
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,240
there is a chance that he or she won’t have 
any claims during the policy year. We could  

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,640
easily relate to personal lines of business 
such as automobile or homeowner insurance.
 

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,400
Let’s examine some applications 
of the individual risk model.  

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,160
The model was originally developed for life 
insurance portfolio. Consider term-life  

19
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,840
insurance that pays a fixed amount of insurance 
to the beneficiary upon the death of the insured.  

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:31,040
For the ith individual in the portfolio, let 
qi be the probability of death within a year,  

21
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:41,040
and bi be the payable amount from the insurer 
upon death. Then the loss for the ith contract  

22
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:49,840
is described by random variable Xi which 
has a probability mass at zero and bi.
 

23
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,680
In property casualty insurance, it is 
more complicated. For a single contract,  

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,600
one can still think that the policyholder incurs 
loss events within a year with probability qi.  

25
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:16,480
However, given occurrence, the amount of loss 
is not fixed, instead, it is a random quantity.  

26
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,120
In this case, the loss for the ith contract 
in the portfolio, denoted by Xi, can be  

27
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:35,840
represented using a two-part framework, where I 
indicates the occurrence of loss events, and B  

28
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,760
is the amount of losses given occurrence. 
Both I and B are random variables,  

29
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,560
and B reduces to a fixed amount in 
the above life insurance example.
 

30
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,040
Consider the Wisconsin Property Fund 
data that we introduced in Chapter one.  

31
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,600
We use data in year 2010 to 
illustrate the two-part model.  

32
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:18,400
Variable I is defined as an indicator, with 1 
indicating occurrence of claims, and 0 otherwise.  

33
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,640
Variable B corresponds to the amount of 
losses for the subset of policyholders  

34
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:35,040
with at least one claims. If we take a look at 
the length of the two variables, we note that  

35
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:43,600
I is defined for all policyholders, but B is 
only defined for a subset of policyholders.
 

36
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,840
One could also examine the empirical distribution 
of variables I and B. As an illustration,  

37
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,640
table is used to create the frequency 
table for claim frequency. We observe  

38
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:12,800
that the probability of having loss events for 
a randomly selected policyholder is about 36%.  

39
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,920
summary is used to calculate the 
descriptive statistics for claim severity.  

40
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:32,160
We observe that the amount of losses is skewed 
and heavy tailed. The above analysis assumes  

41
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,200
that the distributions of claim frequency and 
severity are i.i.d. across all policyholders.
 

42
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:51,440
Last, we discuss computing the distribution for 
the aggregate loss. Recall that the aggregates  

43
00:05:51,440 --> 00:06:01,600
loss S is defined as the sum of n random 
variables. In general, its cdf is difficult to  

44
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,760
evaluate due to the multivariate integration 
involved in the computation. When Xi are i.i.d.,  

45
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:20,640
it is known as the n-fold convolution of the cdf 
of X. We present a couple of examples in R.
 

46
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:34,560
In R, function convpow from the distr package 
calculates the distribution of the sum of  

47
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:42,240
independent random variables using discrete 
Fourier transformation. In the first example,  

48
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:52,080
we determine the distribution of the sum of an 
exponential variable and a log-normal variable.  

49
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:04,000
In function convpow, one specifies the sum in the 
first argument and 1-fold in the second argument.  

50
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,960
Function d returns the 
density of the distribution.  

51
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,840
The plot visualizes the density of 
the sum of the two variables.
 

52
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:27,280
In the second example, we examine the 10-fold 
convolution of an exponential distribution.  

53
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:37,920
In function convpow, one specifies the exponential 
distribution in the first argument and 10-fold  

54
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,880
convolution in the second argument. The 
plot shows the resulting gamma density.
 

55
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,920
To summarize, in this section, we have learned 
how to build an individual risk model for a  

56
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:04,880
portfolio of insurance contracts, apply individual 
risk model in life and nonlife insurance, and  

57
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:13,760
compute the distribution of aggregate losses from 
an individual risk model. Thanks for watching.
