Welcome to the tutorial on aggregate loss 
models. My name is Peng Shi, a professor in  

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,080
the Risk and Insurance department at 
the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,440
In this video, I discuss the effect of coverage 
modifications on the aggregate loss.
 

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,680
Several contractual provisions 
of an insurance contract  

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,080
could affect the aggregate loss of the 
insurer. This section focuses on deductible.  

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,320
We discuss two types of deductibles, the aggregate 
deductible and the per-occurrence deductible.
 

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,520
The aggregate deductible applies to the 
aggregate losses of the insurer. Let S
 

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,520
be the aggregate loss which can be 
from either an individual risk model  

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,000
or a collective risk model. With an 
aggregate deductible d, the insurer  

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,480
is liable for the amount of losses in excess 
of the deductible, that is, (S−d)+.
 

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,880
Insurance on aggregate losses, subject to a 
deductible, is called stop-loss insurance.  

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,160
This agreement is often used 
between an insurer and a reinsurer,  

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,360
where the insurer puts a cap d on the 
losses from a portfolio of policies.
 

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,560
The expected cost of this insurance 
is called the net stop-loss premium.  

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,400
It can be calculated as difference 
between the expected aggregate  

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:57,360
loss and the expected losses below deductible. 
The calculation requires the knowledge of the  

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,600
distribution of the aggregate loss, which 
we have discussed in previous sections.
 

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,960
The per-occurrence deductible 
applies to each loss event.  

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,640
Therefore, it makes sense to think of 
aggregate loss using the collective risk model.  

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,920
We will see that the deductible affects both claim 
frequency and claim severity in this context.
 

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,480
When there is a per-occurrence deductible,  

22
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,720
the insurer is only liable for the claims with 
ground-up loss greater than the deductible.  

23
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,280
In fact, small claims might not even 
be reported to the insurer. Let N
 

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:03:00,080
be the number of loss events and NP be the 
number of payments. One could also interpret  

25
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:09,680
NP as the number of reported claims. We could 
represent NP as a compound frequency distribution.  

26
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:19,760
The indicator I is created to count the number 
of reported loss events. The probability of  

27
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,720
reporting is calculated as the probability 
of ground-up loss exceeding deductible.
 

28
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,600
The relation between the distribution of N  

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:41,760
and NP can be established using probability 
generating functions. This relation will  

30
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,920
allow us to derive the distribution of 
NP for a given distribution of N.
 

31
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,320
For instance, if the number of loss 
events N is Poisson with mean λ,  

32
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
using the probability generating function,  

33
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:13,280
we can show that the number of reported claims 
NP is also Poisson with mean vλ, where v
 

34
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:21,040
is the probability that the claim amount 
is great than deductible. Similar results  

35
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,840
can be obtained for other frequency 
distributions introduced in Chapter 2.
 

36
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,200
The per-occurrence deductible affects not only 
the number of claims, but also the amount of  

37
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:46,960
each claim. For a given claim, let X be the 
ground-up loss and XP be the amount of payments.  

38
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,840
Then XP can be calculated as difference 
of the ground-up loss and the deductible.  

39
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,200
We emphasize that XP is defined only when X>d.  

40
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,680
This definition also allows us to establish the 
relation between the distributions of XP and X.
 

41
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,720
Now we have discussed how a per-occurrence  

42
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,280
deductible affects claim frequency and claim 
severity. Combining the two components,  

43
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:35,200
we can express the insurer’s loss using 
a collective risk model, where NP
 

44
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:43,280
is the number of reported claims, and XP is the 
amount of payments for individual claims.
 

45
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:54,880
To summarize, in this section, we 
have learned how to price stop-loss  

46
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,800
insurance, and examine the effect 
of per-occurrence deductible on  

47
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,120
frequency and severity components in the 
collective risk model. Thanks for watching.
