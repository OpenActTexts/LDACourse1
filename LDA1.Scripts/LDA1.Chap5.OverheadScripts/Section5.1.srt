Welcome to the tutorial on aggregate loss 
models. My name is Peng Shi, a professor in  

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,080
the Risk and Insurance department at 
the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,600
In this video, I am going to give an 
introduction to aggregate loss models.
 

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:26,480
A primary focus of insurers is to estimate 
the cost of insured events under the insurance  

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:34,960
contracts. Intuitively, we know that the total 
losses to an insurer are affected by both the  

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:43,200
frequency and the severity of the insured event. 
This chapter will discuss probability models  

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,040
for aggregate losses that use frequency 
and severity as building blocks.
 

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,600
In previous chapters, we have discussed reasons 
why frequency and severity are often studied  

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:09,680
separately, and we have learned basic probability 
models for frequency and severity. Let’s review  

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,040
some important terminologies that we 
continue to use in this section.
 

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:27,280
Loss, also known as ground-up loss, refers to the 
amount of financial losses of the insured. Claim  

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:35,520
represents the amount of losses covered by the 
insurer. The distinction between loss and claim  

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,000
is due to the contractual provisions 
such as deductible and policy limit.
 

14
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,760
Frequency measures how often an insured 
event occurs during the policy year.  

15
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,320
Severity describes the amount or 
size of losses for an insured event.  

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,520
Aggregate losses or aggregate claims denote 
the total amount of payment by the insurer  

17
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,440
for a single policy or an insurance 
portfolio in a policy year.
 

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,000
The goal of this section is to build a 
probability model for the total payments  

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,760
by an insurance system in a fixed time period. One 
thinks of an insurance system as a broad concept,  

20
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,480
it could be a single insurance contract or a 
portfolio of insurance policies that are from  

21
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:49,040
either a line of business or an insurer’s entire 
book of business. We will show that frequency  

22
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,440
and severity are the building blocks that one 
uses to construct the aggregate loss model.
 

23
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,120
We introduce two approaches for aggregating 
losses on a defined set of insurance contracts  

24
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,400
over a fixed time period, the individual 
risk model and the collective risk model.  

25
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,040
In the individual risk model, one records 
the losses for each individual claim  

26
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:32,960
and then add them up to obtain the total amount of 
losses. In contrast, in the collective risk model,  

27
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:43,360
one records the losses at policy level, then the 
total losses are calculated as the sum of losses  

28
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:51,440
from all individual policies. One should 
note that the two methods are equivalent  

29
00:03:51,440 --> 00:04:00,080
and lead to the same amount of total 
losses for the insurance portfolio.
 

30
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:10,080
To illustrate the concepts, let’s consider a toy 
example. Assume an insurance portfolio consists  

31
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,680
of four contracts. The table summarizes 
their claim histories during the policy year.  

32
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:28,800
Policy #1 had no claims, and Policy #2, 
Policy #3, and Policy #4 had one, two, and  

33
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:37,840
three claims respectively. The loss amount 
for each claim is 10 dollars. To obtain the  

34
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:45,280
total losses for the portfolio, the individual 
risk model examines losses for each policy,  

35
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:57,600
i.e. 0, 10, 20, 30 dollars for the four policies. 
In contrast, the collective risk model records  

36
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:09,840
6 claims and a 10-dollar loss for each claim. Both 
methods calculate a total losses of 60 dollars.
 

37
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,160
Aggregate loss models can be useful 
in various actuarial applications.  

38
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:26,480
For instance, in ratemaking, an aggregate loss 
model can be used to model the total losses  

39
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:34,000
for a single policyholder in the contract 
year, and insurers are interested in the  

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,640
expected amount of losses for pricing purposes. 
In capital management and risk financing,  

41
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:52,320
it is sensible to consider an aggregate loss model 
for an insurance portfolio. In these applications,  

42
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,760
insurers are more concerned with the large losses 
on the tail of the aggregate loss distribution.
 

43
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,640
To summarize, in this section, we have learned 
how to record aggregate losses for an insurance  

44
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:19,360
system. We introduced the basic concepts of two 
equivalent methods, the individual risk model  

45
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:27,840
and the collective risk model. We also discussed a 
range of actuarial applications of aggregate loss  

46
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:36,960
models, including ratemaking, capital management, 
and risk financing. Thanks for watching.
