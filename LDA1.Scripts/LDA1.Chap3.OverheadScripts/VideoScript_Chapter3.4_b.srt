00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,540
Hello, welcome back to this video on introduction
to Loss Data Analytics

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,470
My name is Nii Okine; I am an assistant professor
at the Maths Department of Appalachian State

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,470
University.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:17,529
In this video, we are going to continue our
discussion on the impacts of coverage modifications

5
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:23,089
with a focus on policy limits.

6
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:29,259
Under a limited policy, the insurer is responsible
for covering the actual loss X up to the limit

7
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:35,660
of its coverage. This fixed limit of coverage
is called the policy limit and often denoted

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:44,940
by u. If the loss exceeds the policy limit,
the difference X?u has to be paid by the policyholder.

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,190
While a higher policy limit means a higher
payout to the insured, it is usually associated

10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,210
with a higher premium.

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:58,830
Let Y denote the amount of paid claim by the
insurer. The variable Y is known as the limited

12
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:09,320
loss variable and is denoted by X?u and the
wedge means take the minimum of X or u. Therefore,

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,600
the limited loss variable is equal to X for
X less than or equal to u and equal u for

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,280
X greater than u.

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,100
The limited loss random variable Y is a right
censored variable because values above u are

16
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,159
set equal to u.

17
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:37,740
It can be seen that the distinction between
YL and YP is not needed under the limited

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,499
policy as the insurer will always make a payment.

19
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:52,829
Even when the distribution of X is continuous,
the distribution of Y is a hybrid combination

20
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:53,979
of discrete and continuous components.

21
00:01:53,979 --> 00:02:02,909
The discrete part of the distribution is concentrated
at Y=u, when X>u, while the continuous part

22
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,729
is spread over the interval Y<u , when X?u.

23
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:13,870
Also, for the discrete part, the probability
that the loss exceeds the policy limit u is

24
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:22,010
1? cdf of X at u. And for the continuous part
of the distribution, Y=X.

25
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:29,959
Hence the pdf of Y is equal to the pdf of
X for y between 0 and u and equal to 1? cdf

26
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,090
of X at u for y=u.

27
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:40,709
Accordingly, the distribution function of
Y is equal to the cdf of X for y between 0

28
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:53,049
and u and equal to 1 for values y greater
than or equal to u.

29
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:58,760
The raw moments of Y can be found directly
using the pdf of X and given as the integral

30
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,769
from 0 to u of X to the power k multiplied
by the pdf of X dx and to account for the

31
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:15,390
payments of u for X greater than u we add
u to the power k multiplied by 1- cdf of X

32
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,390
at u.

33
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,470
Alternatively, an expression for the moments
can be obtained using the survival function

34
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:29,989
which is given by the integral from 0 to u
of kx to the power k-1 multiplied by 1- cdf

35
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:31,400
of X dx.

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,629
Therefore when k=1, the expected value of
Y also known as the limited expected value

37
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:50,550
is equal to the integral from 0 to u of 1-
cdf of X dx.

38
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,470
We now consider a situation where the loss
random variable X follows a Pareto distribution

39
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,430
with parameters theta and alpha.

40
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:03,760
Recall that for the Pareto distribution, the
survival function of X is given theta/ sum

41
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,870
of x and theta, all to the power alpha and
the mean is given by theta divided by alpha

42
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,870
minus one.

43
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:17,669
Thus the expected value of Y is equal to the
integral from 0 to u of the survival function

44
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:24,870
of x that is theta/ sum of x and theta, all
to the power alpha dx.

45
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,250
With some algebra, we obtain the expected
value of Y equals to theta divided by alpha-1

46
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:46,630
multiplied by 1- theta/ sum of u and theta,
all to the power alpha-1.

47
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,160
Using the definitions of the payment per loss
variable which takes the positive of X?d and

48
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,520
the limited loss variable which takes the
minimum of X and d, it can be easily seen

49
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,940
that the loss random variable X is equal to
the payment per loss random variable and the

50
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,639
limited loss random variable.

51
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,720
This implies, the expected payment without
any coverage modification, E(X), is equal

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,210
to the sum of the expected payments with deductible
d and limit d.

53
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,080
We now consider a scenario where the loss
random variable X follows a Pareto distribution

54
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,270
with parameters theta and alpha.

55
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:28,400
Thus the expected value of X is equal to theta
divided by alpha -1. From the previous slide

56
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,949
we saw the expression for the expected value
of the limited loss variable using a Pareto

57
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:34,949
distribution.

58
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,620
Then we can find the expected value of the
payment per loss random variable by subtracting

59
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,560
the expected limited loss random variable
from the expected payment without any coverage

60
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,389
modification, E(X). With some algebra, the
expression for the expected value of the payment

61
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,290
per loss random variable is given as shown.

62
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:02,360
Recall that, the expected payment without
any coverage modification, E(X), is equal

63
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,620
to the sum of the expected payments with deductible
d and limit d.

64
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,090
From our previous video on deductibles, the
loss elimination ration is equal to the expected

65
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,849
value of the loss random variable without
any coverage modification minus the expected

66
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:23,590
value of the payment per loss variable, all
divided by the Expected value of the loss

67
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,220
random variable without any coverage modification.

68
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,550
Then the loss elimination ratio can be expressed
as the expected value of the limited loss

69
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:40,889
variable with limit d divided by the Expected
value of the loss random variable without

70
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,120
any coverage modification.

71
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,220
We now consider an actuarial exam question.

72
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,050
We have been given that under a group insurance
policy, an insurer agrees to pay 100% of the

73
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:58,370
medical bills incurred during the year by
employees of a small company, up to a maximum

74
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:06,240
total of one million dollars. The total amount
of bills incurred, X, has pdf equal to x multiplied

75
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,360
by (4-x) all divided by 9 for x between 0
and 3 and equal to zero elsewhere.

76
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,960
Note that x is in millions. We are to calculate
the total amount, in millions of dollars,

77
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,550
the insurer would expect to pay under this
policy.

78
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,099
To answer this question, first, we need to
define the limited random variable Y, which

79
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:35,410
is equal to x for x less than or equal to
1 and equal to 1 for x greater than 1.

80
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:43,620
Then, the expected value of the limited loss
variable Y is given by the integral from 0

81
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:54,150
to 1 of x squared multiplied by (4-x) all
divided by 9 dx + 1 multiplied by the integral

82
00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:06,580
from 1 to 3 of x multiplied by 4-x divided
by 9 dx. Solving gives us 0.935.

83
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:16,069
Now we discuss an example of R code that we
can use to calculate the limited expected

84
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,780
values under a deductible policy.

85
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,880
For this example, we assume the claim severities
follow a lognormal distribution, and we discuss

86
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,960
two functions to calculate expected values
under a deductible policy.

87
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,329
The first chunk of codes assigns the parameters
for the lognormal distribution and simulates

88
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:35,519
the claims severities based on lognormal distribution.

89
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:43,079
The second chunk of codes provides the mlnorm
function, that calculates unlimited expected

90
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:49,800
values of claim severities and the levlnorm
function that calculates the expected values

91
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,550
of the claims retained by the insured under
a deductible policy based on the lognormal

92
00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:00,220
distribution. As you can see these two functions
are user defined.

93
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,110
The third chunk of codes calculates the lognormal
function's expected value and compares it

94
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,040
to the mean of claims from the claims data.

95
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,550
The final chunk of code calculates the expected
value of the claims retained by the insured

96
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,251
using the levlnorm function and compares it
to the amounts retained by the insured from

97
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:30,500
claims data. Here the pmin function is different
from the min function. The pmin are applied

98
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:38,000
to two or more numeric vectors with the same
length. pmin returns the parallel minima of

99
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,050
two or more input vectors, where the output
is a vector of the same length as the input

100
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,380
vectors.

101
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:58,130
In this video, we discussed the limited loss
random variable which is equal to x for x

102
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,680
less than the policy limit u and equal to
the policy limit u for x greater u.

103
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,060
The limited random variable is a right censored
variable because values above u are set equal

104
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
to u.

105
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,029
The expected value of limited random variable
is also known as the limited expected value.

106
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:22,560
We also showed that using the definitions
of the payment per loss variable and the limited

107
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,480
loss variable, it can be easily seen that
the loss random variable X is equal to the

108
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,209
sum of payment per loss random variable and
the limited loss random variable. Which implies,

109
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:38,160
the expected payment without any coverage
modification, E(X), is equal to the sum of

110
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,310
the expected payments with deductible u and
policy limit. U.

111
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:49,600
Finally, the limited expected value is equal
to the integral from 0 to u of the survival

112
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,670
function of X dx.

113
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,390
Thank you for watching this video.
