00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello, my name is Fei Huang, a senior 
lecturer at the UNSW Sydney.
 

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,200
In this video, we will review Section 3.2  

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,400
Continuous Distributions for 
modelling Loss Severity. 
 

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,960
In particular, we learn how to define and 
apply four fundamental severity distributions:  

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,520
gamma, Pareto, Weibull, and generalized 
beta distribution of the second kind. 
 

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,320
The first distribution is the gamma distribution. 
The probability density of a gamma distribution  

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,720
with shape parameter \alpha and scale parameter 
\theta is defined by this formula in this slide.  

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,680
When \alpha=1, the gamma reduces to an exponential 
distribution. When \alpha=n/2 and \theta=2,  

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,280
the gamma reduces to a chi-square distribution 
with n degrees of freedom. As we will see in  

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,680
Section 15.4, the chi-square distribution is used 
extensively in statistical hypothesis testing.
 

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,920
In this slide, we use the two plots to demonstrate 
the effect of the scale and shape parameters on  

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,160
the gamma density function. In the left-hand 
panel, we see the gamma density plots with  

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:23,520
shape=2 and varying scale parameter. While in the 
right-hand panel, we see the Pareto Density plots  

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,880
with scale=100 and varying shape parameter. 
The distribution function of a gamma model is the  

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,120
incomplete gamma function and defined 
in the formula in this slide. 
 

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,080
We can also define the k-th raw moment, mean, 
and variance of the gamma distributed random  

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:51,120
variable for any positive k. For example, the 
mean is \alpha times \theta and the variance is  

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,920
\alpha times \theta^2. Since all moments exist 
for any positive k, the gamma distribution is  

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,680
considered a light tailed distribution, which 
may not be suitable for modelling risky assets  

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,400
as it will not provide a realistic assessment 
of the likelihood of severe losses.  

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,360
Another important feature of 
the gamma distribution is that  

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,800
it belongs to the exponential family of 
distributions. This means that it is easy  

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,480
to incorporate explanatory variables into the 
distribution via generalized linear modelling. 
 

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,840
Next, we introduce the Pareto distribution. It is 
a positively skewed and heavy-tailed distribution  

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,240
which makes it suitable for modelling income, 
high-risk insurance claims and severity of large  

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,520
casualty losses. For extreme insurance claims, the 
tail of the severity distribution can be modelled  

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,160
using a generalized Pareto distribution. For 
example, in my own research of modelling advanced  

28
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,000
age mortality, I used the generalized Pareto 
distribution to model mortality over a specific  

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,400
age threshold. The probability density 
function of a two parameter Pareto distribution  

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,440
with shape parameter \alpha and scale 
parameter \theta is given in this slide. 
 

31
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,320
In this slide, we use the two plots 
to demonstrate the effect of the scale  

32
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,760
and shape parameters on the Pareto density 
function. In the left-hand panel, we see the  

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,200
Pareto Density plots with scale 2000 and varying 
shape parameter. While in the right-hand panel,  

34
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,000
we see the Pareto Density plots with 
shape 3 and varying scale parameter. 
 

35
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,360
In this slide, we show the distribution function 
of the Pareto distribution, the k-th raw moment,  

36
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
the mean and variance of the Pareto 
distributed random variable. 
 

37
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,400
The third distribution we introduce 
here is called the Weibull distribution.  

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,960
The probability density function of the Weibull 
distribution is given by this formula with shape  

39
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,840
parameter \alpha and scale parameter \theta. We 
can also calculate the hazard function of the  

40
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,640
Weibull distribution, which is the probability 
density function over the survival function.  

41
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:24,880
The hazard function is a decreasing function when 
\alpha<1, indicating heavy tailed distribution.  

42
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,680
It is constant when \alpha=1 and increasing when 
\alpha >1, indicating light tailed distribution. 
 

43
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,920
We also show the distribution 
function of the Weibull distribution  

44
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,960
given at the bottom of the slide. 
In this slide, we derive the k-th raw moment,  

45
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,720
the mean and variance of the Weibull 
distributed random variable. 
 

46
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,120
The fourth distribution we introduce is the 
generalized Beta distribution of the second  

47
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,800
kind, denoted by GB2 distribution. It is a 
four-parameter, very flexible distribution  

48
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,200
that can model positively as well as negatively 
skewed distributions. We show the probability  

49
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,160
density function of the GB2 distribution and 
the beta function via the formulas there. 
 

50
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,200
The GB2 distribution can provide a model 
for heavy as well as light tailed data. It  

51
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,200
includes many distributions as special cases, 
such as exponential, gamma, Weibull, etc.  

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:40,400
For example, suppose we have 2 independent Gamma 
distributed random variables G1 and G2. Then  

53
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:50,240
the random variable \theta times (G1/G2)^\sigma 
has a GB2 distribution. When the moment exists,  

54
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,640
we can also compute the k-th raw moment 
using the bottom formula in this slide. 
 

55
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,440
In Exercise 3.2.1, we will be working 
with the Wisconsin Property Fund data.  

56
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,040
We have read the data and created a vector 
of the log of non-zero claim values.  

57
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,840
You will be asked to plot a histogram of the 
data using the hist function in R and use the  

58
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,760
`str` function to review the elements of the 
list returned by the histogram function.  
 

59
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,080
In Exercise 3.2.2, we will focus on the 
gamma distribution from Section 3.2.1  

60
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,120
to help you develop an intuition as 
to how the distribution responds to  

61
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,360
changes in its shape and scale parameter. 
From Figure 3.1, you should recognize that  

62
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,800
the support for the gamma distribution is 
positive real numbers. You ll also note that  

63
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,400
the distribution allows for varying levels 
of right-skewness. You can use the `hist`  

64
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,960
function to plot a histogram of the data, use 
the `dgamma` function to return density values,  

65
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,840
and use the curve` function to plot the 
gamma distribution over the histogram data.  

66
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,200
Please be careful in setting the arguments of 
each function. In this exercise, you will also  

67
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,240
have the chance to calculate shape and scale 
parameters using the method of moments.
 

68
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,880
Packages in R exist for most 
continuous distributions,  

69
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,840
however, it is useful to be able to 
know how to write your own functions.  

70
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,760
In R, a function is an object so the R interpreter 
is able to pass control to the function,  

71
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,840
along with arguments that may be necessary for 
the function to accomplish the actions. Functions  

72
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,560
allow you to automate common tasks in a more 
powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting.  

73
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:04,080
In Exercise 3.2.3, we will write an R function to 
find the density (the pdf) of a random variable  

74
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,400
that follows a Pareto distribution. 
In summary, in this section,  

75
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,280
we learnt how to define and apply four 
fundamental severity distributions,  

76
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:25,840
including gamma, Pareto, Weibull, and generalized 
beta distribution of the second kind.
