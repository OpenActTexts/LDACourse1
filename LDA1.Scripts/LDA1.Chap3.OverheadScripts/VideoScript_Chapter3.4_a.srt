Hello, welcome back to this video on 
introduction to Loss Data Analytics
 

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,440
My name is Nii Okine; I am an assistant 
professor at the Maths Department of  

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,520
Appalachian State University.
In this video, I will discuss the  

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,640
impacts of coverage modifications with a 
focus on policyholder deductibles.
 

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,240
We now consider a risk retention framework 
where an insurer is obligated to pay  

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,440
a portion of a loss amount X suffered by an 
insured under an insurance contract. We denote Y  

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,360
to be the insurer s payment. 
This section introduces standard  

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,360
mechanisms that insurers use to reduce or 
mitigate their risk, including deductibles,  

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,920
policy limits, and coinsurance. We 
will also introduce reinsurance,  

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,800
an insurance mechanism for insurance 
companies. Further, we will examine  

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,400
how the distribution of the insurer s 
obligations depends on these mechanisms.
 

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,240
In this video, we focus on 
impacts of deductibles.
 

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Under an ordinary deductible policy, the insured 
(policyholder) agrees to cover a fixed amount  

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,560
of an insurance claim before the insurer 
starts to pay. This fixed expense paid  

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,640
out of pocket is called the deductible and 
often denoted by d. If the loss exceeds d,  

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,080
then the insurer is responsible for covering 
the loss X less the deductible d. 
 

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,360
Depending on the agreement, the 
deductible may apply to each covered loss  

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,720
or the total losses during a defined benefit 
period (such as a month, year, etc.)
 

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,240
Regarding the benefit paid to the policyholder 
Y, we differentiate between two variables:  

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,800
The payment per loss variable and 
the payment per payment variable.
 

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,720
The payment per loss variable is denoted 
by YL or (X-d)+, where (X-d)+ means  

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,240
take the positive part of of the X-d variable. 
The payment per loss is equal to zero for values  

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,720
of X that are less than or equal to d 
and equal to X-d for values of X that  

24
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,160
are greater than d. Hence it is referred to 
as a left-censored and shifted variable.
 

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,200
On the other hand, the payment per payment 
variable denoted by YP is defined only when  

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,400
there is a payment. Specifically, YP equals 
X?d on the event X is greater than d. 
 

27
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,320
Here, YP is often referred to as 
left truncated and shifted variable  

28
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,120
or excess loss variable because the 
claims smaller than d are not reported,  

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:56,800
and values above d are shifted by d.
Even when the distribution of X is continuous,  

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,080
the distribution of the payment per loss 
variable YL is a hybrid combination of  

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,160
discrete and continuous components. The discrete 
part of the distribution is concentrated at Y=0  

32
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,160
when X?d, and the continuous part is 
spread over the interval Y>0, when X>d. 
 

33
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,880
For the discrete part, the 
probability that no payment is made  

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,760
is the probability that losses 
fall below the deductible;  

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,800
which is equal to the cdf of X at d. 
Also, using the transformation YL=X?d  

36
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,960
for the continuous part of the distribution, 
the pdf of YL is equal to cdf of X at d  

37
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,652
when y=0 and equal to pdf of X at y+d when y>0.
Accordingly, the cdf of YL is equal to cdf of X  

38
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:47,760
at d when y=0 and equal to the cdf 
of X at y+d when y>0.
 

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,960
We can see that the payment per payment 
variable is the payment per loss  

40
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:22,000
variable conditional on the loss exceeding the 
deductible. Alternatively, YP can be expressed  

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,760
as the loss in excess of the deductible given 
that the loss exceeds the deductible. Hence,  

42
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:40,320
the pdf of YP is given by pdf of X at y+d divided 
by 1- cdf of X at d for y greater than zero.
 

43
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,320
Accordingly, the distribution function of YP can 
be found directly using the pdf of X and equal to  

44
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:59,360
the cdf of X at y+d - cdf of X at d all divided by 
1- cdf of X at d for y greater than zero.
 

45
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,680
The raw moments of YL can be found directly 
using the pdf of X and given as the integral  

46
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,720
from d to infinity of X-d to the power 
k multiplied by the pdf of X dx. 
 

47
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,960
Similarly, the raw moments of YP 
are given by the raw moments of YL  

48
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,080
divided by 1- the cdf of X at d. 
When k=1, we can use the survival  

49
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,360
function to calculate the expected value of YL 
and given by the integral from d to infinity  

50
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,000
of 1- cdf of X dx. This could be 
easily proved if we start with the  

51
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,320
initial definition of expected payment per loss 
variable and use integration by parts.
 

52
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,680
Also, when k=1, the expected value of 
YP is known as mean excess loss ex(d)  

53
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,720
and equal to the expected value of YL 
divided by 1- the cdf of X at d.
 

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,840
We now consider an actuarial exam question. 
We have been given that losses have the density  

55
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,880
function equal to 0.02x for x values 
between 0 and 10 or zero otherwise.  

56
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,560
Further, the insurance has an ordinary 
deductible of 4 per loss. If we define YP  

57
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,440
as the claim payment per payment random variable, 
we want to calculate the expected value of YP. 
 

58
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,720
To answer this question, first, we need to define 
the YP random variable, which is defined only when  

59
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:56,240
there is a payment, i.e., YP equals X?4 on 
the event the loss X is greater than 4. 
 

60
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,880
Then, the expected value of YP also known 
as mean excess loss can be expressed  

61
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:13,120
as the integral from 4 to 10 of (x-4) 
multiplied by 0.02x dx, all divided by 1-  

62
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:23,200
the cdf of X at 4. Solving gives us 3.43
Note that we divide by survival at 4, i.e.,  

63
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:30,400
1- the cdf of X at 4, as this is the probability 
where the variable YP is defined.
 

64
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,280
We have seen that the deductible d imposed 
on an insurance policy is the amount of  

65
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,840
loss that has to be paid out of pocket 
before the insurer makes any payment.  

66
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,000
The deductible d imposed on an insurance 
policy reduces the insurer s payment and  

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,080
reduce premiums for the policyholders.
The loss elimination ratio is the percentage  

68
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,440
decrease in the expected payment of the 
insurer as a result of imposing the deductible.  

69
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,480
It is defined as the expected value of the loss 
random variable without any coverage modification  

70
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,440
minus the expected value of the payment per 
loss variable, all divided by the expected  

71
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,520
value of the loss random variable without 
any coverage modification. 
 

72
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,240
A little less common type of policy 
deductible is the franchise deductible.
 

73
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,840
The franchise deductible will apply to the 
policy in the same way as ordinary deductible  

74
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,520
except that when the loss 
exceeds the deductible d,  

75
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,280
the full loss is covered by the insurer. 
The payment per loss variable YL takes the  

76
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:53,040
value of zero for values of X that are less than 
or equal to d and the value of X for values of  

77
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
X that are greater than d. 
On the other hand,  

78
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,320
the payment per payment variable YP is equal X 
on the event X is greater than d. 
 

79
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,120
In this video, under an ordinary deductible 
policy we differentiate between two variables:  

80
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,760
The payment per payment variable YP and 
the payment per loss variable YL.
 

81
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,840
These two variables are based on what 
information is available to the insurer. 
 

82
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,000
The payment per payment variable YP is often 
referred to as left truncated and shifted  

83
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,160
variable or excess loss variable because 
the claims smaller than d are not reported,  

84
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:42,000
and values above d are shifted by d.
The expected value of YP is known as mean  

85
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,680
excess loss e(d). 
The payment per loss variable  

86
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,760
YL is equal to zero for values of X that are less 
than or equal to d and equal to X-d for values of  

87
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,480
X that are greater than d. Hence it is referred 
to as a left-censored and shifted variable.
 

88
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,960
The expected value of YL 
can be written as the mean  

89
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,160
excess loss e(d) multiplied by survival at d. 
Also, we can use the survival function to  

90
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,520
calculate the expected value of YL 
which is given by the integral from d  

91
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,560
to infinity of the survival of X dx. 
Thank you for watching this video.
