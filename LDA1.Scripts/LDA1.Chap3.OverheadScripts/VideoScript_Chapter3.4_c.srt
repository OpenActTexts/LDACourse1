00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,700
Hello, welcome back to this video on introduction
to Loss Data Analytics

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,980
My name is Nii Okine; I am an assistant professor
at the Maths Department of Appalachian State

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,980
University.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:18,910
In this video, we are going to continue our
discussion on the impacts of coverage modifications

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,940
with a focus on coinsurance, and reinsurance.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:31,560
Under a coinsurance policy, the retained loss
by the insurer is a percentage of the incurred

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
loss X.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,239
The percentage ?, often referred to as the
coinsurance factor, is the percentage of claim

9
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,620
the insurance company is required to cover.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,429
If the policy is subject to an ordinary deductible
and policy limit, coinsurance refers to the

11
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:52,649
percentage of claim the insurer is required
to cover, after imposing the ordinary deductible

12
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,190
d and policy limit u.

13
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:00,139
Then, the payment per loss variable, YL, is
equal to zero for values of X that are less

14
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:06,510
than or equal to d, equal to alpha multiplied
by X-d for values of X that are greater than

15
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:14,640
d but less than of equal to u, and equal to
alpha multiplied by u-d for values of X greater

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,869
than u.

17
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:26,460
The maximum amount paid by the insurer in
this case is ?(u?d), while u is the maximum

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,799
covered loss.

19
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:39,650
When a loss is subject to both a deductible
d and a limit u the per-loss variable YL can

20
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,640
be expressed as the limited loss variable
at the limit u minus the limited loss variable

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:52,290
at the limit d. With coinsurance, the payment
per loss random variable YL can be expressed

22
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,299
as alpha multiplied by the limited loss variable
at the limit u minus the limited loss variable

23
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,299
at the limit d.

24
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,219
Then the expected value of the payment per
loss variable equal to the alpha multiplied

25
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:09,060
by the limited expected value at u minus the
limited expected value at d.

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,640
The k-th moment of the payment per loss random
variable is expressed using the initial definition

27
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:22,780
of payment per loss variable and given as
shown.

28
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:30,330
A growth factor (1+r) may be applied to X
resulting in an inflated loss random variable

29
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,530
(1+r)X

30
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:39,630
With the prespecified d and u remain unchanged,
the resulting per loss variable can be written

31
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:50,090
as equal to zero for values of X that are
less than or equal to d divided by 1+r, equal

32
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:56,490
to alpha multiplied by (1+r)X-d for values
of X that are greater than d divided by 1+r

33
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:06,010
but less than or equal to u divided by 1+r,
and equal to alpha multiplied by u-d for values

34
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,700
of X greater than u divided by 1+r.

35
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:18,450
Note that the limit and deductible are divided
by 1+r to correspond to the deflated values.

36
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:26,210
The first moment of the payment per loss variable
equal to the alpha multiplied by 1+r multiplied

37
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:32,090
by the limited expected value at u divided
by 1+r minus the limited expected value at

38
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:39,120
d divided by 1+r. In this case we have the
maximum covered loss and the deductible at

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,510
their deflated values, computed the average
payment, and then reinflated back.

40
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,150
For the second moments, we can incorporate
inflation in a manner similar to the formulas

41
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,270
for first moments. However, since the second
moment is in dollars squared,

42
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:01,170
we reinflate back by multiplying by (1+r)
squared. Also, we multiply by the coinsurance

43
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,600
factor squared. Then the second moment can
be expressed as shown.

44
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,440
One can combine the formulas for the first
and second moments in order to calculate the

45
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
variance.

46
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,150
The formulas given for the first and second
moments of YL are general. Under full coverage,

47
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:26,180
?=1, r=0, u=?, d=0 and expected value of YL
reduces to expected of X.

48
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:38,740
If only an ordinary deductible is imposed,
?=1, r=0, u=? and expected value of YL reduces

49
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,280
to expected of X minus limited expected value
at d.

50
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,840
If only a policy limit is imposed ?=1, r=0,
d=0 and expected value of YL reduces to limited

51
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,610
expected value at u.

52
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,460
We now consider an actuarial exam question.

53
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:05,710
We have been given that the ground up loss
random variable for a health insurance policy

54
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:12,360
in 2006 is modeled with X, a random variable
with an exponential distribution having mean

55
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,270
1000. An insurance policy pays the loss above
an ordinary deductible of 100, with a maximum

56
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,510
annual payment of 500. The ground up loss
random variable is expected to be 5% larger

57
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:31,820
in 2007, but the insurance in 2007 has the
same deductible and maximum payment as in

58
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:39,050
2006. Find the percentage increase in the
expected cost per payment from 2006 to 2007.

59
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:48,090
To answer this question, first, we need to
define the amount per loss variable YL for

60
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,900
2006, and 2007.

61
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:58,770
The amount per loss variable YL for 2006 is
equal to zero for values of X that are less

62
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:05,960
than or equal to 100, equal to X-100 for values
of X that are greater than 100 but less than

63
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:14,060
or equal to 600, and equal to 500, that is
600 minus 100 for values of X greater than

64
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,820
600.

65
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:25,920
Also, with inflation rate equal to 5%, the
amount per loss variable YL for 2007 is equal

66
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:36,260
to zero for values of X that are less than
or equal to 100 divided by 1.05 that is 95.24,

67
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:47,650
equal to 1.05X-100 for values of X that are
greater than 95.24 but less than or equal

68
00:06:47,650 --> 00:07:00,511
to 571.43 which is 600 divided by 1.05, and
YL is equal to 500 that is 600 minus 100 for

69
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:05,290
values of X greater than 571.43.

70
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:12,180
The expected cost per payment from 2006 is
equal to the expected cost per loss from 2006

71
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:20,340
divided by survival of X at the deductible
100. Solving using the limited loss random

72
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:27,199
variable and survival function based on the
exponential distribution gives us an answer

73
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,600
of 393.469.

74
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:38,669
Similarly, solving for the expected cost per
payment from 2007 gives us an answer of 397.797.

75
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:46,030
Then, the percentage increase in the expected
cost per payment from 2006 to 2007 is given

76
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:54,200
by the expected cost per payment from 2007
divided by the expected cost per payment from

77
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,610
2006 minus 1. Which is equal to 1.1%

78
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:08,030
Therefore, there is an increase of 1.1% from
2006 to 2007. Due to the policy limit, the

79
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:17,300
cost per payment event grew by only 1.1% between
2006 and 2007 even though the ground up losses

80
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,940
increased by 5% between the two years.

81
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:28,590
Here, we discuss an example of R code that
we can use to calculate the expected value

82
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,379
of the claims insured subject to a deductible
and a policy limit.

83
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:38,399
The first chunk of code assigns the parameters
for the lognormal distribution and simulates

84
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,899
the claims severities.

85
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:45,069
The second chunk of code determines the number
of claims resulting in reimbursement both

86
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:52,949
from the data and based on the lognormal model
using plnorm, the distribution function of

87
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:58,839
the lognormal model.
The third chunk of code calculates the expected

88
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,279
value of the claims insured subject to a $1
million deductible and a $5 million policy

89
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,279
limit.

90
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,889
The last chunk of code calculates the expected
value of the claims insured subject to a $1

91
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:16,089
million deductible and a $5 million policy
limit based on the lognormal distribution

92
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:22,320
using the levlnorm function, a user-defined
function introduced in the previous video.

93
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,769
The tutorial you will be working on at the
end of this video will require you to calculates

94
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:34,291
the expected values of claims under a policy
with a deductible, policy limit, and coinsurance.

95
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:44,180
In a 
deductible policy insurance contract, there

96
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,649
is a contractual arrangement under which an
insured transfers part of the risk by securing

97
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:55,949
coverage from an insurer in return for an
insurance premium. Under that policy, the

98
00:09:55,949 --> 00:10:01,009
insured must pay all losses up to the deductible,
and the insurer only pays the amount (if any)

99
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,040
above the deductible.

100
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,779
Under the reinsurance, there is a contractual
arrangement under which an insurer transfers

101
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:15,360
part of the underlying insured risk by securing
coverage from another insurer referred to

102
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,279
as a reinsurer in return for a reinsurance
premium.

103
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,990
Although reinsurance involves a relationship
between three parties: the original insured,

104
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:33,179
the insurer often referred to as cedant and
the reinsurer, the parties of the reinsurance

105
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:39,470
agreement are only the primary insurer and
the reinsurer. There is no contractual agreement

106
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,389
between the original insured and the reinsurer.

107
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,699
Though many different types of reinsurance
contracts exist, a common form is the excess

108
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:54,480
of loss coverage. In such contracts, the primary
insurer must make all required payments to

109
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,529
the insured until the primary insurer s total
payments reach a fixed reinsurance deducible.

110
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:06,519
The reinsurer is then only responsible for
paying losses above the reinsurance deductible.

111
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:14,290
The maximum amount retained by the primary
insurer in the reinsurance agreement is called

112
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,290
retention.

113
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:21,160
Reinsurance arrangements allow insurers with
limited financial resources to increase the

114
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,130
capacity to write insurance and meet client
requests for larger insurance coverage while

115
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:34,029
reducing the impact of potential losses and
protecting the insurance company against catastrophic

116
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,449
losses.

117
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:41,940
Reinsurance also allows the primary insurer
to benefit from underwriting skills, expertise

118
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:50,379
and proficient complex claim file handling
of the larger reinsurance companies.

119
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:58,470
This is the last video in a series of three
videos in this section. We introduced standard

120
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,929
mechanisms that insurers use to reduce or
mitigate their risk, including deductibles,

121
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,679
policy limits, and coinsurance.

122
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:11,930
In this video, we evaluated the impacts of
coinsurance and inflation on insurer's costs.

123
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:17,600
And we examined how the distribution of the
insurer's obligations depends on these mechanisms.

124
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,759
We also introduced reinsurance, a mechanism
of insurance for insurance companies, and

125
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,980
discussed the advantages of reinsurance to
the primary insurer.

126
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,050
Thank you for watching this video.
