Hello, my name is Fei Huang, a senior 
lecturer at the UNSW Sydney. 
 

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,520
In this video we will review Section 
3.1 Basic Distributional Quantities. 
 

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,600
In particular, we learn how to define 
some basic distributional quantities,  

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,040
including moments, percentiles, 
and generating functions. 
 

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,760
We first define raw moments. Let X be a continuous 
random variable with probability density function  

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:41,280
f_x(x) and distribution function F_x(x). The 
k-th raw moment of X, denoted by \mu_k , is the  

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,920
expected value of the k-th power of X, provided 
it exists. We can see that the formula for the  

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,680
k-th raw moment is presented at the bottom of the 
slide. A special case is the first raw moment,  

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,120
which is the mean of X, denoted by \mu.
Next, we define the central moment of X, denoted  

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,320
by \mu_k, which is the expected value of the k-th 
power of the deviation of X from its mean \mu. The  

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,640
formula for \mu_k is given on this slide. We can 
see that compared with the raw moment formula, the  

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,280
central moment focuses on the deviation of X from 
its mean \mu, while the raw moment focuses on X.  

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,840
A special case is the second central moment, 
which is the variance of X denoted by \sigma^2.  

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,400
The square root of the variance is 
the standard deviation \sigma. 
 

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,840
Now we consider two additional special cases 
based on the third and the fourth central moments,  

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,280
skewness and kurtosis. Skewness is a measure 
of symmetry of the probability distribution,  

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,160
defined as the ratio of the third central 
moment to the cube of the standard deviation. A  

18
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,240
positive coefficient of skewness indicates that 
the distribution is skewed to the right. We also  

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,880
call it positively skewed. Kurtosis is a measure 
of the tailedness of the probability distribution,  

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,000
defined as the ratio of the fourth central moment 
to the fourth power of the standard deviation.  

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,120
The normal distribution has a coefficient of 
kurtosis of 3. Distributions with a coefficient  

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,360
of kurtosis greater than 3 have heavier 
tails than the normal, whereas distribution  

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,080
with a coefficient of kurtosis less than 
3 have lighter tails and are flatter. 
 

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,920
In Section 3.1.2 we discuss the concept 
of quantiles. When the distribution of  

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,200
X is continuous, for a given fraction p,  

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,760
the corresponding quantile is the solution of the 
equation in this formula. For example, when p=0.5,  

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:00,800
\pi_0.5 is the middle point of the distribution, 
called the median. You may come across another  

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,320
similar concept, called the percentile. 
A percentile is a type of quantile;  

29
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,080
a 100p percentile is the number such that 
100p percent of the data is below it. 
 

30
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,280
In this slide we can see the relationship 
between mean and median under different skewness.  

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,120
For symmetrical distribution, the mean and 
median are the same. However, for a positively  

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,840
skewed (or right-skewed) distribution, the mean 
is bigger than the median. And for a negatively  

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,480
skewed (or left-skewed) distribution, the 
mean is smaller than the median. 
 

34
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:54,480
In Section 3.1.3, we discuss the moment 
generating function (mgf), denoted by M_X(t).  

35
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Moment generating function uniquely characterizes 
the distribution of X. As we can see from the  

36
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:11,360
formula given in this slide, the mgf is defined as 
the expectation of e^{tX}, for all t for which the  

37
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,560
expected value exists. We can see that the k-th 
derivative at zero is equal to the k-th raw moment  

38
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,600
of X, as shown by the formula at the bottom. 
A related concept to moment generating function  

39
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,720
is the probability generating function. The 
probability generating function can be computed  

40
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,080
using the moment generating function of log z. The 
probability mass function of X can be recovered by  

41
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,440
taking derivatives of the probability generating 
function for discrete random variables.
 

42
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,640
In Exercise 3.1.1, you will 
be given a dataset called  

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Anscombe s quartet. In this exercise, you 
will consider 4 variables, y1, y2, y3 and y4.  

44
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,960
And you will be able to summarise the data 
through summary, mean, var, and sd R functions.  

45
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,760
You will also practice the calculation 
of the coefficient of skewness. 
 

46
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:24,080
Exercise 3.1.2 uses the data of the Wisconsin 
Property Fund. It includes claim values y as  

47
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,880
well as the claim year Year. For this exercise you 
will work with the natural logarithm of the claim  

48
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:38,240
values which are in the lny variable. We have 
filtered the data to exclude zero claims. This  

49
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,160
exercise is to help you understand the shape of a 
distribution, and changes in the shape as another  

50
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,920
variable changes through the boxplot function. 
You will be able to use the quantile function to  

51
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,800
evaluate different "percentile" values. 
Here we can see an illustration of boxplot.  

52
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:05,200
Boxplots have been a very popular statistical 
graphic, especially for exploratory data analysis  

53
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,680
when you re trying to understand the data. 
As we can see in this plot, it shows the minimum,  

54
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:19,840
maximum, median, as well as 25th and 
75th percentiles in a compact way. 
 

55
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,440
In Exercise 3.1.3, you will be able to 
apply the moment generating function  

56
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:35,120
using R for a gamma distribution. This exercise 
references some low-level functions like eval  

57
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,920
and parse. It also mentions how environments 
work. These topics are helpful for developing  

58
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,720
an advanced understanding of R. The parse function 
converts a character vector to an expression.  

59
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,880
Then, you can use the eval function to 
evaluate the expression. You can also use  

60
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,200
the D function to compute derivatives. For 
more information about these R functions,  

61
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,040
please check the corresponding R help 
manual using the help() function. 
 

62
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,560
In this section, we learned how to define 
some basic distributional quantities,  

63
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:25,920
including moments, percentiles, and 
generating functions.
