Hello, welcome back to this video on introduction
to Loss Data Analytics

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,830
My name is Nii Okine; I am an assistant professor
at the Maths Department of Appalachian State

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,830
University.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,380
In this video, I am going to discuss different
methods of creating new distributions.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:26,900
In the previous sections of this chapter,
we discussed some important and commonly known

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,150
continuous distributions.

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:34,809
Some of the continuous distributions discussed
are gamma, Pareto, Weibull, and generalized

8
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:38,210
beta distribution of the second kind or GB2
distribution.

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,309
Continuous distributions are used to model
continuous variables, for example, the claim

10
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:45,769
sizes or amount.

11
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:51,760
In this section, we will be discussing two
main approaches to creating new distributions.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,629
The first approach, which will be covered
in this video, concerns creating new distributions

13
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,789
by transforming the random variable of a distribution.
Under this approach, we will look at three

14
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:05,600
transformation techniques for creating new
distributions, that is, multiplying by a constant,

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,060
raising to a power, and exponentiation.

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,150
In the following slides, we will discuss these
common techniques in detail.

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,810
The second approach, which will be covered
in the next video, deals with creating a new

18
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,330
distribution by combining other distributions.
Two common techniques to combine distributions

19
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:29,240
under the second approach are Mixing and Splicing.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:37,710
We first consider creating new distributions
by multiplying a random variable by a positive

21
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,710
constant.

22
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,210
In insurance, such transformations can be
useful to adjust for the change in claim data

23
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:49,700
over time due to inflation. To adjust for
inflation, we multiply the losses X by 1+inflation

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:57,580
rate. For example, if the inflation rate is
8%, we can create a new variable Y=1.08X.

25
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:04,180
We can also use such transformations to convert
a loss random variable X in dollars to thousands

26
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,000
of dollars. Such that the new variable Y=1/1000X.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,540
Another application of such transformations
is to convert losses to different currencies

28
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,470
by multiplying the random variable X by the
exchange rate.

29
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,490
In general, the new variable is given by Y=cX,

30
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,120
Because the distribution function of the random
variable X is known, it can be shown that

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,950
the distribution function of Y is given by
the cdf of X evaluated at y/c.

32
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:47,230
Using the chain rule for differentiation,
we can obtain the pdf of the new variable

33
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,970
Y as 1/c times the pdf of X at y/c.

34
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:05,420
In a scale distribution, the new variable
Y=cX is in the same set of distributions as

35
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,490
the random variable X.

36
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:13,490
In general, when a member of a scale distribution
is multiplied by a constant c, the scale parameter

37
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,880
meets two conditions:
1. The parameter is changed by multiplying

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,630
by c;
2. All other parameters remain unchanged.

39
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,520
Many loss distributions are scale distributions.
For example, Gamma distribution.

40
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:41,280
The next transformation technique we take
a look at is Raising to a power. This technique

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,040
involves raising the random variable to a
power.

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,569
Looking at the Weibull distribution origins,
we recognize that the Weibull is a Power transformation

43
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:54,620
of the exponential distribution. We will return
to this relationship between the exponential

44
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,300
and Weibull distribution in the next couple
of slides.

45
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,489
Under the Raising to a Power technique, the
new variable Y is defined by Y=X raise to

46
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,770
the power tau.

47
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,550
We examine three cases of tau.

48
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:17,690
The first case is when tau> 0. In this case,
it can be shown that the cdf of the new variable

49
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:25,660
Y is given by the cdf of X evaluated at y
raised to the power one divided by tau.

50
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,690
We then use the chain rule for differentiation
to obtain the pdf.

51
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:36,530
On the other hand, when tau< 0. It can be
shown that the cdf of the new variable Y is

52
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:44,030
given by one minus the cdf of X evaluated
at y raised to the power one divided by tau.

53
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:51,330
Again, to obtain the pdf of the new variable
Y, we apply the chain rule of differentiation.

54
00:04:51,330 --> 00:05:00,370
For the third case, we consider tau=-1. Then,
the new variable Y is the inverse of X. The

55
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:12,260
cdf and pdf of Y is a special case of the
case when tau< 0.

56
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,740
Here is an example of transforming an exponential
distribution to an inverse exponential distribution

57
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,880
using the inverse transformation.

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,710
Suppose that X has an exponential distribution
with parameter theta star, then an inverse

59
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,460
transformation will give us Y=1/X.

60
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,389
The distribution function of Y is given by
exp raise to the negative one divided by the

61
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,930
product of y and theta star.

62
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:47,620
If we define a new parameter theta= 1/theta
star, then the resulting distribution function

63
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:57,680
is that of an inverse exponential function
with parameter theta.

64
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,639
We can also transform an Exponential distribution
into a Weibull distribution.

65
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,840
Here, we start with a variable X which follows
an exponential distribution with parameter

66
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
1.

67
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,021
Then we can define a new random variable of
the form: Y=theta multiplied by X to the power

68
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:18,021
1 divided by tau.

69
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:21,169
Here theta and tau are positive parameters.

70
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:34,900
Then we can show that the cdf of Y is that
of the Weibull function with parameters theta

71
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
and tau.

72
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,400
Another type of transformation involves exponentiating
a random variable X so that the new variable

73
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,259
Y is defined by Y= e to the power X.

74
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:52,820
Then the cdf of Y is given by the cdf of X
evaluated at the natural log of y

75
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,710
And we obtain the pdf by the chain rule.

76
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:04,022
The normal distribution is a very popular
model for a wide number of applications. If

77
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:10,460
a random variable X has a normal distribution,
then Y= e to the power X follows a lognormal

78
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,460
distribution.

79
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,630
The lognormal distribution is positively skewed
with a long right tail and is commonly used

80
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,870
to describe financial assets such as stock
prices.

81
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:29,150
Also, the natural log transformation is another
transformation that is commonly used in actuarial

82
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:36,009
practice. When the new variable Y is equal
to the natural log of X, then the cdf of Y

83
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:44,790
is given by the distribution function of X
evaluated at e to the power y. When we use

84
00:07:44,790 --> 00:08:04,479
the chain rule, the pdf of Y is given by x
multiplied by the pdf of X at x.

85
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:11,190
Here we discuss an example of R code that
we can use to obtain the pdf of a log transformed

86
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,580
variable Y and create a plot.

87
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,639
For this example, we assume a Gamma distribution,
so the first two lines assign values for the

88
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,840
shape parameter alpha and scale parameter
theta.

89
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,990
The next line assigns values to X, representing
the claim severities. We then use the dgamma

90
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:36,450
function in R to generate a pdf of the claim
severities, assuming the Gamma distribution

91
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,979
with the above parameters.

92
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:47,010
The next chunk of codes transforms the x variable
using natural logarithms to obtain y. Then

93
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:55,070
the pdf of Y is given by x multiplied by the
pdf of X at x. The last line of code plots

94
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,640
the pdf curve of the log claim severity.

95
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,920
In this video, we provided foundations for
creating new distributions. Specifically,

96
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,600
we looked at an approach that deals with transforming
a random variable of a distribution. We discussed

97
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,310
techniques such as multiplication by a constant,
raising to a power, and exponentiation.

98
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,260
We also provided connections among distributions.
For example, we discussed the connection between

99
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:33,010
the exponential and inverse exponential functions
and also the exponential and Weibull functions.

100
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,600
